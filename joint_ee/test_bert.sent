[unused1] [unused2] Former senior banker Callum McCarthy begins what is one of the most important jobs in London ' ##s financial world in September , when incumbent Howard Davies steps down .
[unused1] [unused2] Davies is leaving to become chairman of the London School of Economics , one of the best ##- ##k ##no ##wn parts of the University of London .

[unused1] [unused2] Russian President Vladimir Putin ' ##s summit with the leaders of Germany and France may have been a failure that proves there can be no long ##- ##ter ##m ` ##` peace camp ' ##' alliance following the end of war in Iraq , government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend .
[unused1] [unused2] The comments indicate that Russia ' ##s n ##uan ##ced position over the war in Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled , with Putin pushing to protect his b ##uddin ##g friendship with US President George W ##. Bush in the face of stride ##nt opposition from the Russian media and other top K ##rem ##lin officials .
[unused1] [unused2] Ana ##ly ##sts have long argued that Putin is far keen ##er to preserve friendly relations with the United States than the pro ##- ##E ##uro ##pe ##an , anti ##- ##war camps embedded in much of the Russian media and the foreign and defense ministries .
[unused1] [unused2] Ko ##mmer ##san ##t business daily joined in , declaring in a furious front ##- ##page headline : ` ##` The United States is demanding that Russia , France and Germany pay for the Iraqi war . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg with Jacques Chi ##rac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Sc ##hr ##oe ##der on Saturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in a post ##- ##war revival of Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] The call reflected the insist ##ent demand made by the three leaders before the US ##- ##B ##rit ##ish invasion of Iraq that UN approval was essential for any mission to top ##ple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .
[unused1] [unused2] But the Saint Petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration on Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Putin had even secretly invited British Prime Minister Tony Blair , Bush ' ##s s ##ta ##unch ##est back ##er in the war on Iraq , to attend the p ##ow ##- ##wo ##w in Saint Petersburg ' ##s Grand Hotel Europe , although diplomat ##s said Blair turned the offer down .
[unused1] [unused2] It remains to be seen how successful Putin ' ##s over ##tures to Washington will be in the face of the f ##erve ##nt internal hostility to the US war stance .
[unused1] [unused2] Hari ##ri submitted his resignation during a 10 ##- ##min ##ute meeting with the head of state at the Ba ##ab ##da presidential palace , outside the capital .
[unused1] [unused2] The current government was formed in October 2000 .
[unused1] [unused2] Under the power ##- ##sha ##ring arrangement reached following the end of Lebanon ' ##s 15 ##- ##ye ##ar civil war in 1990 , the prime ministerial post is always held by a Sunni Muslim and the presidency by a Mar ##oni ##te Christian .
[unused1] [unused2] Married for the second time , Hari ##ri has five children .
[unused1] [unused2] At least three members of a family in India ##s northeastern state of Trip ##ura were ha ##cked to death by a tribal mob for allegedly practicing witch ##craft , police said Thursday .
[unused1] [unused2] A spokesman said a group of 25 to 30 armed men Wednesday attacked a house belonging to a village q ##ua ##ck doctor in Tu ##lt ##uli , 60 kilometers - ##LR ##B ##- 38 miles - ##R ##RB ##- south of Trip ##ura ##s state capital A ##gart ##ala .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The mob dragged out three members of a family and - ##LR ##B ##- killed - ##R ##RB ##- them with mac ##he ##tes and spears before fleeing the area , ' ##' the spokesman said by telephone from A ##gart ##ala .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` It was believed Na ##ot ##ia was a practicing so ##rcerer and through his black magic he had cast evil spells on villagers , prompting a group within the village to eliminate them , ' ##' the spokesman said .
[unused1] [unused2] Police have arrested four people in connection with the killings .
[unused1] [unused2] Silence is golden - ##- especially when your hand is weak - ##- top Moscow policy analysts said in an assessment of the fall ##out from Russia ' ##s vocal opposition to what turned out to be a swift US ##- ##led campaign in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Several top diplomacy experts told a K ##rem ##lin ##- ##run forum that countries like China and India that said little about the conflict before its March 20 launch were already re ##ap ##ing the benefits .
[unused1] [unused2] One analyst said China - ##- which like Russia and France w ##ield ##s a UN Security Council veto but never threatened to use it to prevent the war - ##- recently won its role as chief media ##tor between the United States and North Korea because other regional powers ' confidence in Russia fell as a result of its Iraqi diplomacy .
[unused1] [unused2] N ##ego ##tia ##tions between Washington and P ##yon ##gy ##ang on their nuclear dispute have been set for April 23 in Be ##jin ##g and are widely seen here as a blow to Moscow efforts to stamp authority on the region by organizing such a meeting .
[unused1] [unused2] French President Jacques Chi ##rac received only a reserved response when he tried to men ##d fences by placing a telephone call Tuesday to Bush .
[unused1] [unused2] Meanwhile German Chancellor Gerhard Sc ##hr ##oe ##der has not spoken to Bush since several weeks before the start of the war .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Our analysis of foreign policy is lacking and often re ##vert ##s to Cold War stereotypes , ' ##' said former deputy foreign minister Ana ##to ##ly Adam ##ishi ##n .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We were so proud of forming an anti ##war b ##loc with France and Germany - ##- but nations have not been forming such b ##loc ##s for at least 12 years and someone in Moscow should have understood that it was impossible to a ##vert this war . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] US diplomat ##s have hinted in recent weeks that Washington ' ##s anger with European resistance to the campaign was focused more on Paris - ##- and to a lesser extent Berlin - ##- than it was with Moscow .
[unused1] [unused2] They are scheduled to meet next in the Russian leader ' ##s native city of Saint Petersburg in late May .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We lost nothing and won nothing - ##- this was not our war , ' ##' said liberal law ##maker I ##rina K ##hak ##ama ##da of the Union of Right ##ist Forces .
[unused1] [unused2] Most analysts linked Russia ' ##s opposition to a war in Iraq to fears that it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now ##- ##top ##pled regime of Saddam Hussein .
[unused1] [unused2] Putin will face re ##- ##ele ##ction in March 2004 and analysts noted that the war - ##- while opposed by most Russians - ##- was never turned by the K ##rem ##lin into a matter of national security .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` I do not think that this will affect the elections unless Russia ' ##s failure in Iraq is presented as an issue of national security - ##- and has not been yet , ' ##' said Viktor Ku ##val ##din of a research center funded by former Soviet president Mikhail Go ##rb ##ache ##v .
[unused1] [unused2] Malaysia ' ##s Appeal Court Friday refused to over ##turn the conviction and nine ##- ##ye ##ar jail sentence imposed on ex ##- ##de ##put ##y prime minister An ##war Ibrahim for so ##dom ##y .
[unused1] [unused2] An ##war , 56 , who this week completed four years in prison on a corruption charge , now faces an earliest possible release date of April 14 , 2009 if he is given one third re ##mission of his sentence for good behaviour .
[unused1] [unused2] The former heir ##- ##ap ##par ##ent to Prime Minister Ma ##hat ##hir Mo ##ham ##ad , who says he was framed for political reasons , told reporters after his appeal was rejected : ` ##` You must remember its pre ##- ##sel ##ec ##ted judges , most junior of the court of appeal , and its all scripted .
[unused1] [unused2] Ma ##hat ##hir ' ##s sack ##ing of the ch ##aris ##matic and popular An ##war in September 1998 rocked Malaysian politics , with thousands of people taking to the streets to demonstrate their support for him .
[unused1] [unused2] Within weeks he was arrested and charged with so ##dom ##ising an official driver several years previously and with a ##bus ##ing his powers to cover up the offence .
[unused1] [unused2] The conduct of the trials was widely criticised internationally and the United States still lists An ##war as a political prisoner .
[unused1] [unused2] An ##war was told Monday that he had been granted a standard one ##- ##thi ##rd re ##mission of a six ##- ##ye ##ar corruption sentence for good behaviour , and immediately began to serve the nine ##- ##ye ##ar sentence for so ##dom ##y .

[unused1] [unused2] South Korea ' ##s ruling party is facing an internal reform ##ist call for di ##sso ##lving itself to create a new group after a hum ##ilia ##ting defeat at last week ' ##s by ##- ##ele ##ctions , party officials said Tuesday .

[unused1] [unused2] Bel ##ea ##gue ##red French media group V ##ive ##ndi Universal is in advanced negotiations to sell its theme park business to a US firm for around 1 ##. ##5 billion dollars , the Los Angeles Times said Friday .
[unused1] [unused2] The report came as the in ##de ##bt ##ed group said it was planning to sell off its US unit V ##ive ##ndi Universal Entertainment and other assets , to focus on its te ##le ##com ##s activities and its French cable television business .

[unused1] [unused2] S ##hal ##om told a joint press conference that the tiny Gulf state ' ##s strong relationship with the recently appointed Palestinian prime minister , Ma ##hm ##ud Abbas , could be a boost for peace .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We discussed the Middle East peace process .

[unused1] [unused2] The meeting was S ##hal ##om ' ##s first encounter with an Arab counterpart since he took office as Israel ' ##s foreign minister on February 27 .

[unused1] [unused2] The report did not give the amount of the fine , but said it would be ` ##` ex ##po ##nent ##ially larger ' ##' than the historic 10 million dollars X ##ero ##x paid the SEC last year .

[unused1] [unused2] Thousands of Iraq ' ##s majority Shi ##ite Muslims marched to their main mosque in Baghdad to mark the birthday of Islam ' ##s founder Prophet Mohammed .
[unused1] [unused2] The crowd filled the street leading to the Ka ##zi ##miya mosque in the northeast of Baghdad and carried banner ##s in the green color of Islam , calling for good government .
[unused1] [unused2] The demonstration came as Iraq ' ##s top US oversee ##r Paul B ##rem ##er began his second week on the job amid continuing law ##lessness in the country .
[unused1] [unused2] In his f ##ren ##zie ##d first seven days , the te ##leg ##eni ##c B ##rem ##er repeatedly promised to restore the law and order that c ##rum ##bled along with Saddam Hussein ' ##s regime nearly six weeks ago .
[unused1] [unused2] But despite issuing a host of tough decree ##s , B ##rem ##er has failed to stem the ramp ##ant crime and street violence p ##lag ##uing the country .
[unused1] [unused2] Despite a security crack ##down over the weekend in Baghdad and an announcement that some 7 ##, ##00 ##0 policemen had returned to their jobs since the end of the war , ordinary Iraqi ##s still felt un ##safe on the street with gunfire r ##ife and police a near invisible presence .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We want to have an Iraqi voice in everything we do here but it would be wrong to do that pre ##ci ##pit ##ously , ' ##' said a source at the Organisation of Reconstruction and Human ##itarian Assistance - ##LR ##B ##- OR ##HA - ##R ##RB ##- , which is administer ##ing post ##- ##war Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Official ##s from Iraqi groups that met with B ##rem ##er last week have said that he back p ##edd ##led on what they said were earlier pledge ##s to give them a lead role in forming a new interim government in the next few weeks .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We understand that they want to have as much power as possible but we told them : ` You w ##o n ##' ##t be directly elected , you w ##o n ##' ##t have any direct experience of government , ' ##' the source said .
[unused1] [unused2] ' ##' ` Of course you will have input into the government but , since you are not directly elected , it would be a nonsense for you to have direct executive power , ' the source said .
[unused1] [unused2] The comments came on the same day that a prominent Iraqi called for internationally ##- ##su ##per ##vise ##d elections in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Ad ##nan Pac ##ha ##chi , a one ##time foreign minister who returned to Iraq on May 6 after 33 years in exile , told the independent A ##z ##- ##Z ##aman daily that elections should be held under international supervision .
[unused1] [unused2] An interim government should create an election code and laws to clear the way for direct elections to a constituent assembly , that would draw up a constitution , Pac ##ha ##chi said .
[unused1] [unused2] A referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a new government , the 80 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Pac ##ha ##chi told the daily .

[unused1] [unused2] He will then stay on for a regional summit before heading to Saint Petersburg for celebrations marking the 300 ##th anniversary of the city ' ##s founding .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` This upcoming visit to Russia will be my first trip aboard since I became president of China .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Our discussions should strengthen political trust between the two sides and mutually beneficial cooperation to raise Russian ##- ##C ##hine ##se relations to a new level , ' ##' he added .
[unused1] [unused2] Putin , who enjoyed a warm relationship with former Chinese president Jiang Z ##em ##ing , has made efforts to n ##urt ##ure ties with Hu and was the first world leader to go to Beijing to meet him in December when he was president ##- ##in ##- ##wai ##ting .
[unused1] [unused2] Russia has given a high priority to its relations with the United States despite a bitter disagreement over the US ##- ##led campaign to top ##ple Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] But China remains a key Russian ally , demonstrated by the fact that Hu will be the only foreign leader apart from US President George W ##. Bush to hold a summit with Putin in the days surrounding the Saint Petersburg festivities .
[unused1] [unused2] Ana ##ly ##sts however caution ##ed against any attempt to turn the focus from economic cooperation to a broader strategic alliance , given that both sides opposed the war in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] US President George W ##. Bush told Canadian Prime Minister Jean Ch ##ret ##ien by telephone Monday that he looked forward to seeing him at the upcoming summit of major industrial ##ized nations and Russia , the White House said Tuesday .

[unused1] [unused2] Am ##id a chill in relations over the war in Iraq , which Canada opposed , Bush indefinitely postponed a visit to Canada , instead choosing to host Australian Prime Min ##ster John Howard , who endorsed that military campaign .
[unused1] [unused2] On Monday , Ch ##ret ##ien told reporters that he and Bush , who had not spoken since late February , discussed a wide range of issues , including Iraq , the upcoming summit of the Group of Eight industrial powers and aid to Africa .

[unused1] [unused2] The Houston energy company , which has been the target of a s ##lew of investigations into alleged financial deception , filed a pair of motions in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan in April , said the daily .
[unused1] [unused2] En ##ron ' ##s principal banker ##s , including JP Morgan Chase and C ##iti ##group , and along with numerous other En ##ron adviser ##s , have already been sued by the company ' ##s shareholders for allegedly helping the company hide debt , and they face investigations from regulator ##s over their involvement .

[unused1] [unused2] SA ##IN ##T P ##ET ##ER ##SB ##UR ##G , June 1 - ##LR ##B ##- A ##FP - ##R ##RB ##- - US President George W ##. Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday their friendship was as strong as ever , laying aside a dispute over the Iraq war , but barely conceal ##ing a si ##mmer ##ing row over Iran ' ##s nuclear program .
[unused1] [unused2] After talks in Saint Petersburg ' ##s grand Konstantin ##ovsky Palace , they also warned North Korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations and signed documents implementing the Moscow Treaty , which mandate ##s sharp cuts in Cold War nuclear weapons stocks .
[unused1] [unused2] S ##wa ##pping smiles , hands ##hak ##es and hug ##s at a joint press appearance after talks linked to Saint Petersburg ' ##s 300 ##th anniversary celebrations , Bush and Putin set out to re ##cre ##ate the buddy atmosphere of their previous encounters .
[unused1] [unused2] But both men observed an uneasy truce over US concerns about Russian aid to the nuclear program of Iran , whom Bush has labeled part of an ` ##` axis of evil ' ##' that also included Iraq and North Korea .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We think that it would be wise for Russia to go slow on the Bush ##eh ##r project until the wider Iranian nuclear program is more clearly understood , ' ##' the US diplomat said after the informal summit talks .
[unused1] [unused2] Bush signal ##led that Russia would not pay a similar price as France and Germany for opposing the US ##- ##led war in Iraq , inviting his ` ##` good friend ' ##' Putin to his weekend retreat outside Camp David in Washington in September .
[unused1] [unused2] Putin last visited Bush at his Texas ranch in November 2001 .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` What the president - ##LR ##B ##- Putin - ##R ##RB ##- meant was that at times , and we have come across this , there were un ##rea ##son ##able complaints about Russian companies ' cooperation with Iran , ' ##' said Foreign Minister Igor Ivan ##ov , pointing the finger clearly at the United States after the summit .
[unused1] [unused2] Bush arrived in Saint Petersburg on Saturday , when he also briefly met German Chancellor Gerhard Sc ##hr ##oe ##der , whose opposition to the Iraq war had sour ##ed his relationship with Washington , at a dinner hosted by Putin .
[unused1] [unused2] Bush and Putin were scheduled to leave straight after their talks for the Group of Eight summit of the largest industrial ##ised nations in E ##vian , France .
[unused1] [unused2] India ' ##s has been reel ##ing under a heat ##wave since mid ##- ##M ##ay which has killed 1 ##, ##40 ##3 people .
[unused1] [unused2] The skeleton of a second baby has been found at a rural Wisconsin home where a 22 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old woman ' ##s dead infant was discovered in a blue plastic container June 8 , officials said Monday .
[unused1] [unused2] Kris ##tin Scott , the mother , told police she gave birth secretly to both babies at her parents ' home in Byrd ##s Creek , Rich ##land County , one of unknown sex in April 2001 and the other , a full ##ter ##m girl , January 14 .
[unused1] [unused2] Police arrested her in A ##bil ##ene , Texas , Saturday where she had moved with a friend June 2 .
[unused1] [unused2] She is being held on 50 ##, ##00 ##0 dollars bail on a charge of first ##- ##de ##g ##ree reckless homicide and hiding a corpse in the death of the infant born in January .
[unused1] [unused2] Scott told police she did not tend to the baby , and it died after 30 minutes .
[unused1] [unused2] She said the baby had to die , according to the criminal complaint .
[unused1] [unused2] Scott told investigators she had moved that body around before she moved to Texas , sometimes in the closet at the Byrd ##s Creek house , in the trunk of her car and in the closet of her apartment in Rich ##land Center , the complaint said .
[unused1] [unused2] Super ##mo ##del Rachel Hunter on Tuesday filed for divorce from her est ##ranged rock ##er husband Rod Stewart , four years after the couple separated , court papers showed .
[unused1] [unused2] Hunter , 34 , filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court , citing i ##rre ##con ##ci ##la ##ble differences with the 58 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old rock star to whom she has been married for nearly 13 years .
[unused1] [unused2] New Zealand ##- ##born Hunter reportedly had a fl ##ing with British pop star Robbie Williams , while British star Stewart has been much photographed with his reported girlfriend , blond photographer Penny Lancaster .
[unused1] [unused2] Stewart has said that after two failed marriages , he felt it un ##real ##istic to expect couples to commit to each other for life and suggested that the words ` ##` til death do us part ' ##' should be removed from the wedding ceremony .
[unused1] [unused2] Stewart ' ##s 1979 marriage to Alan ##a Hamilton lasted five years and produced two children .
[unused1] [unused2] Major US insurance group AI ##G is in the final stage of talks to take over General Electric ' ##s Japanese life insurance arm in a deal to create Japan ' ##s sixth largest life ins ##urer , reports said Wednesday .
[unused1] [unused2] American International Group Inc ##. is likely to acquire all shares in GE Edison Life Insurance by the end of September and also take over GE ' ##s US car and fire insurance operations , the reports said .
[unused1] [unused2] The total purchase cost is estimated at 300 billion ye ##n - ##LR ##B ##- 2 ##. ##5 billion dollars - ##R ##RB ##- , the business daily Ni ##hon Ke ##iza ##i and news agency Ji ##ji Press said .
[unused1] [unused2] The acquisition of GE Edison is expected to boost AI ##G ' ##s annual life insurance premium revenue in Japan to about 1 ##. ##1 trillion ye ##n , ranking it sixth in the Japanese life insurance business .
[unused1] [unused2] Palestinian security forces returned Monday to the positions they held in the Gaza Strip before the outbreak of the 33 ##- ##mont ##h Palestinian uprising as Israel removed all major check ##points in the coastal territory , a Palestinian security source said .
[unused1] [unused2] Police officers took up their positions across the Gaza Strip , enjoying a freedom of movement they have not known since the in ##ti ##fa ##da exploded in September 2000 , the source said .
[unused1] [unused2] It is the first time they have had freedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of the in ##ti ##fa ##da , ' ##' the source said .
[unused1] [unused2] The move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the US ##- ##back ##ed Middle East ` ##` road ##ma ##p ' ##' , which aims to end the months of blood ##shed and create a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians .
[unused1] [unused2] Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of Be ##it Han ##ou ##n late Sunday , police took up positions there and in the neighbouring town of Be ##it La ##hi ##ya , he said .
[unused1] [unused2] They also deployed along the border with Israel .
[unused1] [unused2] The hand ##over is a credibility test for the Palestinian Authority , which must show it means business when it comes to re ##ining in hard ##line groups plotting attacks on the Jewish state .
[unused1] [unused2] In another first in the almost three ##- ##ye ##ar in ##ti ##fa ##da , the Israeli army allowed Palestinians free circulation on the trans ##- ##G ##az ##a highway as troops abandoned three major check ##points across the coastal territory .
[unused1] [unused2] Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the Palestinian section of the border crossing , which had been taken over by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising .
[unused1] [unused2] Although the crossing has , in principle , been open for movement between the two territories - ##- while being frequently closed by Israeli for reasons rarely explained - ##- the Palestinian section has been manned by Israel for more than two years .
[unused1] [unused2] With opposition hard ##ening , the White House left open the possibility Tuesday that it would not seek a United Nations vote on its war ##- ##making resolution if the measure was headed for defeat .
[unused1] [unused2] The comments came as President George W ##. Bush and his adviser ##s looked beyond the diplomatic show ##down and made plans for a public relations build ##up to potential war .
[unused1] [unused2] The officials , who spoke on condition of an ##ony ##mity , stressed that a variety of options are on the table and they all depend on the outcome of a U ##. ##N ##. Security Council debate on the U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##back ##ed war resolution .
[unused1] [unused2] Once the vote is resolved one way or another , Bush will in ##tens ##ify his case for war , officials said , bar ##ring un ##fo ##res ##een events such as Saddam suddenly di ##sar ##ming or going into exile .
[unused1] [unused2] In addition to a possible address , they have discussed a presidential news conference and a Cabinet meeting as ways for Bush to communicate his plans to the nation next week .
[unused1] [unused2] As those discussions were taking place behind the scenes , F ##le ##ische ##r told reporters that Turkey would lose a proposed $ 15 billion aid package unless it admits troops into the country for the Iraq conflict .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The particular package that we ' ##ve been talking to them about was pre ##dicated on assistance and cooperation in any plan for the use of force against Iraq , ' ##' F ##le ##ische ##r said .
[unused1] [unused2] S ##lo ##bo ##dan Milo ##se ##vic ' ##s wife will go on trial next week on charges of mi ##sman ##aging state property during the former president ' ##s rule , a court said Thursday .
[unused1] [unused2] Mir ##jana Mark ##ov ##ic , the power behind the scenes during Milo ##se ##vic ' ##s 13 ##- ##ye ##ar reign , is accused of illegally providing their grandson ' ##s na ##nny with a state ##- ##own ##ed luxury apartment in Belgrade in 2000 .
[unused1] [unused2] The Belgrade district court said that Mark ##ov ##ic will be tried along with 10 other Milo ##se ##vic ##- ##era officials who face similar charges of ` ##` inappropriate use of state property ' ##' that carry a sentence of up to five years in jail .
[unused1] [unused2] The trial will start on March 13 , the court said .
[unused1] [unused2] Milo ##se ##vic and his wife w ##ield ##ed enormous power in Yugoslavia for more than a decade before he was swept out of power after a popular revolt in October 2000 .
[unused1] [unused2] The post ##- ##M ##ilo ##se ##vic government later extra ##dit ##ed him to the U ##. ##N ##. war crimes tribunal in The Hague , the Netherlands .
[unused1] [unused2] Mark ##ov ##ic , the leader of the neo ##- ##com ##mu ##nist Yugoslav Left party , lost her parliamentary immunity from prosecution after she failed to become a deputy in the parliament of Serbia and Montenegro , the country that last month succeeded Yugoslavia .
[unused1] [unused2] But inspector ##s also questioned Iraq ' ##s motivation , as it began to give the inspector ##s what they wanted only when the threat of war became immediate .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. President George W ##. Bush said the reports indicated that only a war will make Iraq di ##sar ##m .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraq , however , took the report as an endorsement of its work and argued not only that war plans should be canceled , but that sanctions imposed on it by the Security Council for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be removed .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We demand that the Security Council and the world decide on ... the lifting of sanctions on Iraq in a comprehensive and complete way , ' ##' said a spokesman for a meeting Saturday of Saddam and top ##- ##lev ##el officials , quoted by official Iraqi news media .
[unused1] [unused2] The spokesman , reporting on the meeting , said Iraq called on the Security Council ` ##` to rid the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction since Iraq has become free of them . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] The United States and Britain claim he ' ##s lying , and have assembled a quarter ##- ##mill ##ion troops around Iraq for a possible invasion .
[unused1] [unused2] Despite Iraq ' ##s demands of the Security Council , diplomat ##s were working hard on very different proposals : a U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led plan for di ##sar ##ma ##ment or war by March 17 , and a rival French plan for an emergency summit of Security Council members to come up with a compromise .
[unused1] [unused2] Inspector ##s also returned to a former helicopter airfield where Iraq buried bombs it says were armed with biological weapons in 1991 .
[unused1] [unused2] The Hong Kong Jo ##ckey Club is in talks about buying out the horse racing club in neighboring Macau , a newspaper reported Tuesday .
[unused1] [unused2] Neither club immediately returned phone calls from The Associated Press to in ##quire about the buy ##out talks .
[unused1] [unused2] The ch ##aris ##matic leader of Turkey ' ##s governing party was named prime minister Tuesday , a step that probably boost ##s chances that the United States will get permission to deploy troops in the country along Iraq ' ##s northern border .
[unused1] [unused2] Re ##ce ##p Ta ##y ##yi ##p E ##rdo ##gan , who favors the deployment , hinted that he will re ##shu ##ffle the Cabinet , but gave no indication if he would pu ##rge officials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts have suggested he might do .
[unused1] [unused2] Turks overwhelming ##ly oppose a war _ by 94 percent , according to some polls .
[unused1] [unused2] Earlier this month , the Turkish parliament shocked the United States by rejecting the deployment by just four votes .
[unused1] [unused2] Also in Washington , Turkish Ambassador Far ##ou ##k Lo ##go ##g ##lu told The Associated Press that the U ##. ##S ##. and Turkish mi ##lit ##aries were holding informal discussions on the use of Turkish airs ##pace .
[unused1] [unused2] If the resolution is not passed , Washington would likely want to use the airs ##pace for strikes against Iraq and for air ##lifting troops to northern Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Re ##fu ##sing access to the troop deployment would mean Turkey would lose a US ##$ 15 billion U ##. ##S ##. aid package that Washington has offered to help cushion the country ' ##s economy if there is war .
[unused1] [unused2] Se ##cession by Iraqi Ku ##rds could inspire Turkey ' ##s rebel Ku ##rds , who for 15 years have been fighting for autonomy .
[unused1] [unused2] After he was elected , E ##rdo ##gan said Turkey wanted assurance ##s from the United States on its role in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Defense Secretary Donald H ##. R ##ums ##feld said Tuesday there had been talks that Turkish troops could be deployed ` ##` a short distance from their border to try to avoid refugee in ##fi ##ltration . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi Ku ##rds fear that Turkish troops could move deep into the autonomous en ##clave in northern Iraq and have threatened clashes .
[unused1] [unused2] Prime Minister Abdullah G ##ul resigned earlier Tuesday to make way for E ##rdo ##gan , who won a parliamentary seat in by ##- ##ele ##ctions Sunday .
[unused1] [unused2] E ##rdo ##gan said he would submit his Cabinet list to the president ` ##` as soon as possible , ' ##' and leaders of E ##rdo ##gan ' ##s Justice and Development Party met Tuesday evening .
[unused1] [unused2] G ##ul ' ##s resignation had been long expected .
[unused1] [unused2] E ##rdo ##gan heads the party but was constitutional ##ly barred from running in November elections because he was jailed in 1999 for anti ##- ##se ##cular activities .
[unused1] [unused2] E ##rdo ##gan , a leader of Turkey ' ##s pro ##- ##I ##sla ##mic movement when he was jailed , said he moderate ##d his policies in prison .
[unused1] [unused2] He now also advocates letting in U ##. ##S ##. troops for a war against Iraq even though it is a fellow Muslim state .
[unused1] [unused2] Other legislators surrounded the two to head off a bra ##wl .
[unused1] [unused2] Europe ' ##s divide over Iraq loomed ever larger Tuesday with France and Germany den ##ou ##ncing the U ##. ##S ##. move toward war while British Prime Minister Tony Blair said ou ##sting Saddam Hussein now was key to solving similar c ##rises in the future .
[unused1] [unused2] As European Union leaders rest ##ated their opposing views on Iraq , their foreign ministers debated the impending U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led war against Iraq with EU president Greece keeping up appearances with a pledge to pursue a last ditch effort to avoid war .
[unused1] [unused2] Jo ##sch ##ka Fischer and Dominique de Ville ##pin , the German and French foreign ministers , were to attend a special United Nations Security Council meeting in New York Wednesday , called to issue a last ##- ##min ##ute appeal for a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis .
[unused1] [unused2] ' ##' For us the United Nat ##gion ##s is the key authority ' ##' in re ##sol ##ving the Iraq crisis , Fischer told reporters op ##n arrival at the EU meeting .
[unused1] [unused2] ' ##' War is not justified , ' ##' Fish ##cer told reporters .
[unused1] [unused2] Ahead of the EU meeting , Greek Foreign Minister G ##eor ##h ##ge Papa ##nd ##re ##ou told reporters , ' ##' We have to , and we will continue , to search for a peaceful solution to the crisis . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] The EU meeting could not hide the fact the Iraq crisis has made a mock ##ery of EU aspirations to craft a common foreign policy .
[unused1] [unused2] Britain , Spain , Denmark , Italy , the Netherlands and Portugal back the United States while France and Germany lead a group of nations opposing military action .
[unused1] [unused2] The EU foreign ministers met hours after U ##. ##S ##. President George W ##. Bush gave Saddam 48 hours to leave Iraq or face invasion .
[unused1] [unused2] French President Jacques Chi ##rac said war without U ##. ##N blessing would under ##mine future di ##sar ##ma ##ment efforts .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` To act without the legitimacy of the United Nations ... to favor the use of force over law , is taking a serious responsibility . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] In Berlin , German Chancellor Gerhard Sc ##hr ##oe ##der said there was no justification for war .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Does the threat posed by the Iraqi dictator justify a war , which is sure to kill thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
[unused1] [unused2] Sol ##ana said the EU would help in the humanitarian crisis expected to follow an attack on Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] The EU is set to release 20 million euros - ##LR ##B ##- US ##$ 21 ##. ##5 million - ##R ##RB ##- in immediate humanitarian aid for Iraq if war breaks out and may dip into an ` ##` emergency reserve ' ##' of 250 million euros - ##LR ##B ##- US ##$ 26 ##9 million - ##R ##RB ##- for humanitarian relief .
[unused1] [unused2] In recent weeks , the U ##. ##S ##. military has been transporting military equipment from bases in Germany to the Gulf through the port of Antwerp .
[unused1] [unused2] Defense Minister Andre F ##lah ##aut said on the weekend Belgium would no longer allow such transit ##s _ or use of Belgian airs ##pace .
[unused1] [unused2] _ Greece began e ##va ##cu ##ating its embassy in Baghdad , saying all its personnel would be out of Iraq within a couple of days .
[unused1] [unused2] _ The Dutch government , facing strong public anti ##- ##war pressure , said it would not commit fighting forces to the war against Iraq but added it supported the military campaign to di ##sar ##m Saddam .
[unused1] [unused2] _ In neutral Switzerland , Foreign Minister Michel ##ine Cal ##my ##- ##R ##ey said the United States ' decision to proceed with military action weakened the United Nations .
[unused1] [unused2] Barry Di ##ller resigned as co ##- ##chi ##ef executive of V ##ive ##ndi Universal Entertainment , saying it was appropriate for him to step down while Paris ##- ##base ##d V ##ive ##ndi Universal entertain ##s bids for Universal Studios , Universal ' ##s theme parks and other entertainment assets .
[unused1] [unused2] Di ##ller was appointed interim CEO of V ##ive ##ndi Universal ' ##s U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##base ##d entertainment assets last year while V ##ive ##ndi Universal concentrated on repay ##ing a massive debt .
[unused1] [unused2] Cash ##- ##stra ##pped V ##ive ##ndi wants to sell Universal Studios , its Universal theme parks and television production company .
[unused1] [unused2] V ##ive ##ndi also is holding talks with Via ##com , MGM and other buyers interested in acquiring all or parts of its entertainment companies .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Now that V ##ive ##ndi Universal has begun a formal process in reviewing options for its entertainment assets , it is appropriate to step aside from any direct management responsibility . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Di ##ller also is believed to be interested in his own bid for one or more of the entertainment unit ' ##s assets , most likely the film studio .
[unused1] [unused2] In a recent interview , Di ##ller told The Associated Press he would be interested in an opportunity to bid as long as it did not require him to serve as chief executive .
[unused1] [unused2] Di ##ller has served as head of Paramount and T ##wen ##tieth Century Fox , where he helped launch the Fox Television network .
[unused1] [unused2] He started his entertainment career at ABC , where he is credited with creating the ` ##` movie of the week ' ##' concept .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. and British troops were moving on the strategic southern port city of Ba ##s ##ra Saturday after a massive aerial assault pounded Baghdad at dawn .
[unused1] [unused2] The battle for Ba ##s ##ra , an oil hub of some 1 ##. ##3 million people , was underway by mid ##day , with coalition troops trying to surround Iraqi positions and force a surrender .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. aircraft bombed Iraqi tanks holding bridges close to the city .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi forces responded with artillery fire .
[unused1] [unused2] Earlier Saturday , Baghdad was again targeted , one day after a massive U ##. ##S ##. aerial bombardment in which more than 300 Tom ##ah ##aw ##k cruise missiles rain ##ed down on the capital .
[unused1] [unused2] The nine ##- ##sto ##ry Security Headquarters in the Iraqi capital took a direct hit , s ##tre ##wing bricks , masonry and glass across the street in the al ##- ##S ##al ##hi ##ya neighborhood of central Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Allied successes were marred by the collision of two Royal Navy helicopters over the Persian Gulf in which all six British crew members and one American were killed .
[unused1] [unused2] Saturday morning , American Marines and British troops rumbled along the main road from the Kuwait ##i border to Ba ##s ##ra , Highway 80 , nicknamed the ` ##` Highway of Death ' ##' during the 1991 Gulf War , when U ##. ##S ##. airs ##tri ##kes wiped out an Iraqi military convoy along it .
[unused1] [unused2] American units advancing west of Ba ##s ##ra have already secured the R ##ume ##ila oil field , whose daily output of 1 ##. ##3 million barrels makes it Iraq ' ##s most productive .
[unused1] [unused2] Until Ba ##s ##ra , U ##. ##S ##. and British troops had encountered little resistance , even when they seized nearby Um ##m Q ##as ##r , and moved to secure key oil fields .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi ##s mostly fought back with small arms , pistols , machine guns and rocket ##- ##p ##rop ##elle ##d grenades .
[unused1] [unused2] Other units moved into airfield complexes in western Iraq believed to have Sc ##ud missiles capable of reaching Israel , and possibly weapons of mass destruction .
[unused1] [unused2] Early Saturday , more units were waiting in Kuwait to smash through any Iraqi resistance .
[unused1] [unused2] Hundreds of tanks , armored personnel carriers , Hu ##m ##ve ##es and trucks were lined up in parallel columns waiting in single ##- ##fi ##le to cross the Iraqi ##- ##K ##u ##wai ##t border .
[unused1] [unused2] At the same time , however , Turkey sent 1 ##, ##00 ##0 troops into northern Iraq , and the government said it would send more to prevent Iraqi Ku ##rds from creating an independent state .
[unused1] [unused2] The United States strongly oppose ##s any un ##ila ##teral move by Turkey into northern Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] A Turkish military spokesman on Saturday denied Turkish troops had crossed into Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] The United States and Britain suffered their first casualties Thursday and Friday as they pushed into Iraq , with two U ##. ##S ##. Marines killed in combat and another eight British and four American Marines dying in a helicopter crash that appeared to be accidental .
[unused1] [unused2] Australian command ##os , who have been operating deep in Iraq , destroyed a command and control post and killed a number of soldiers , according to the country ' ##s defense chief , Gen ##. Peter Co ##s ##grove .
[unused1] [unused2] In an address Saturday , Information Minister Mohammed Sa ##eed al ##- ##S ##ah ##ha ##f told Iraqi ##s that fighting had been ` ##` fierce . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] He claimed Iraqi troops had destroyed five tanks .
[unused1] [unused2] He said more than 200 Iraqi ##s had been injured , including women , children and other civilians who were being treated at five hospitals in Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Ho ##on said Saddam ' ##s regime was c ##rumbling under the pressure of a huge air assault .
[unused1] [unused2] In a letter to U ##. ##N ##. Secretary ##- ##G ##ener ##al Ko ##fi Anna ##n , Rama ##dan said , ` ##` It is also regret ##table and de ##p ##lora ##ble that the - ##LR ##B ##- U ##. ##N ##. - ##R ##RB ##- General Secretariat has not issued any statement or reaction that con ##de ##m ##ns or de ##p ##lore ##s this aggression . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Despite the heavy bombing , which the U ##. ##S ##. Central Command said targeted military command and control installations , the Iraqi regime gave no sign of quit ##ting .
[unused1] [unused2] Bomber ##s have also hit targets in the northern cities of Mo ##sul , Kirk ##uk and T ##ik ##rit , Saddam ' ##s hometown .
[unused1] [unused2] The Iraqi government released a video of Saddam , in uniform , meeting with his son Q ##usa ##i , the commander of the Republican Guard , and the defense minister , Gen ##. Sultan Has ##him Ahmad .
