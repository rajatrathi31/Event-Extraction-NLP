[unused1] [unused2] Even as the secretary of homeland security was putting his people on high alert last month , a 30 ##- ##foot Cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed men landed on American shores , utterly und ##ete ##cted by the Coast Guard Secretary Ridge now leads .
[unused1] [unused2] He lost an election to a dead man .
[unused1] [unused2] Paul , as I understand your definition of a political - ##- of a professional politician based on that is somebody who is elected to public office .
[unused1] [unused2] And these b ##oz ##os let four armed Cuban ##s land on our shores when they ' ##re trying to make a high terrorist alert .
[unused1] [unused2] Hi ##re professionals , Mr ##. President .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s OK to put Democratic career politicians at the Pentagon and the Justice Department if they ' ##re Democrats but not if they ' ##re Republicans , is that right ?
[unused1] [unused2] Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut made the announcement today that he would not be the 10th candidate for the nomination .
[unused1] [unused2] He explained he could better spend the next two years on homeland security , the economy and judicial nominations .
[unused1] [unused2] In all , two million Americans have lost their jobs under President Bush so far , not to mention three of them being the top three leaders of his economic team .
[unused1] [unused2] It could swell to as much as $ 500 billion if we go to war in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Former Arkansas Governor and U ##. ##S ##.
[unused1] [unused2] You c ##ite a session you had with President Lyndon Johnson in Austin , I guess , at his ranch , right ?
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` When I was majority leader , and later president , I spent all my time pulling every power string I could find to pull , trying to pass bills that helped people .
[unused1] [unused2] I knew it was time to leave . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] And I ' ##ve said many times , if we all agreed on everything , everybody would want to marry Betty and we would really be in a mess , would n ##' ##t we , Bob ?
[unused1] [unused2] Senator B ##ump ##ers , of the 22 senators of the old con ##fe ##der ##acy , when I got to Washington with the Associated Press , 45 years ago , 22 of them were Democrats , nine were Republicans .
[unused1] [unused2] Bob , I think that the reason everybody in the south - ##- you know , first of all , we were - ##- when Franklin Roosevelt was elected president , we had been living what we thought was still a conquered nation after the Civil War .
[unused1] [unused2] And from that time on , that ' ##s the reason we had 22 Democratic senators from 11 con ##fe ##der ##ate states , is because of the Civil War and because of what we thought was a heavy hand of the federal government all the time .
[unused1] [unused2] A million and a half veterans came out of War World II on the G ##I bill and got that kind of an education .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m chewing gum and talking on the phone while writing this note . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Dan Snyder of Baden , Pennsylvania writes , ` ##` Bush should torture the al Qaeda chief operations officer .
[unused1] [unused2] If the budget goes through as is , why do n ##' ##t Mr ##. Be ##gal ##a and Mr ##. Car ##ville just donate the extra tax money they do n ##' ##t want ? ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##ll donate to the Democrats .
[unused1] [unused2] He had to sue to become our president , and he keeps trying to br ##ibe other countries ' democratic governments into his supporting his agenda .
[unused1] [unused2] And now how are people going to argue that the U ##. ##S ##. can no longer both fight a war with Iraq and also fight terrorism , specifically al Qaeda ?
[unused1] [unused2] We go to war in Iraq , 200 ##, ##00 ##0 people start protesting in Pakistan , they put too much pressure on the government .
[unused1] [unused2] We go to war in Iraq , it would be the worst thing we can do ...
[unused1] [unused2] What I ca n ##' ##t stand is a president who is going to screw up our war against terrorism when I thought that was his job .
[unused1] [unused2] Both the AM ##A and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country .
[unused1] [unused2] President Bush points this way today , even the most f ##ri ##vo ##lous of lawsuits cost money , premium ##s go up and either way , the patient pays .
[unused1] [unused2] Let me set aside the h ##y ##po ##c ##ris ##y of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else ' ##s lawsuits , but instead focus on his own experience .
[unused1] [unused2] Here ' ##s what the ` ##` Dallas Morning News ' ##' reported recently : ` ##` The Texas State Board of Medical Ex ##amine ##rs , the agency that pledge ##s to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeon ##s who are thrown out of hospitals because they b ##ot ##ched operations .
[unused1] [unused2] It has refused in the last five years to re ##voke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors .
[unused1] [unused2] If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine .
[unused1] [unused2] Because someone pays money in a case , the insurance company may pay money because they ' ##re afraid there ' ##s is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system .
[unused1] [unused2] Actually , Troy Brennan , the same doctor at Harvard Public School of Health said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits , it ' ##s too many .
[unused1] [unused2] Less than 10 percent of the victims of medical ma ##l ##pra ##ctic ##e , and we ' ##re talking about horrific injuries here , even file a claim .
[unused1] [unused2] And the entire pay ##- ##out to all of the victims that get a little money , not the 90 percent who never file a claim , amounts to less than what we spend on dog food .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s about $ 5 ##. ##4 billion is the pay ##- ##out .
[unused1] [unused2] Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium , right ?
[unused1] [unused2] ... pay ##offs have been stable , adjusted for inflation , National P ##rac ##ti ##tion ##ers Data ##bank - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , let ' ##s look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harm ##ed by a bad doctor .
[unused1] [unused2] If harm ##ed by a do ##c , they ought to be able to recover their economic costs , economic losses .
[unused1] [unused2] Tell someone who had a double mast ##ec ##tom ##y , tell an infant who ' ##s brain ##- ##dam ##aged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they ' ##re going to get d ##ri ##bbled out $ 250 ##, ##00 ##0 for their entire life expect ##ancy ?
[unused1] [unused2] There are awards in 10 million , 20 million , $ 30 million in California for economic .
[unused1] [unused2] Seven ##ty percent of the cases filed are told there ' ##s no payment .
[unused1] [unused2] But here in Washington , President Bush says it ' ##s all a ho ##ax , and many believe he has already made up his mind to go to war .
[unused1] [unused2] Congressman Sanders , you ' ##re opposed to this war .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m not crazy about it myself .
[unused1] [unused2] When the guns begin to fire , when the American men and women are in harm ' ##s way and may be dying , is that now the time for you and your allies to shut up and support the troops ?
[unused1] [unused2] Well it ' ##s not - ##- are you suggesting that when tens and thousands of Iraqi women and children are killed , and when young men and women in this country are un ##ne ##cess ##arily put at harm ' ##s risk , what should we do ?
[unused1] [unused2] And obviously we ' ##re going to pray that there ' ##s fewer casualties ...
[unused1] [unused2] Are you going to demonstrate against them in the streets ?
[unused1] [unused2] No , I do n ##' ##t demonstrate against anybody during a war .
[unused1] [unused2] No , it ' ##s so important - ##- you know this - ##- and I know it ' ##s fun and we love doing partisan Punch & Judy , but is there ever a time when we stand up even if we respect ##fully disagree with the commander in chief and those who would wage war ?
[unused1] [unused2] What I do know is Saddam Hussein has butcher ##ed over a million of his own citizens .
[unused1] [unused2] Furthermore , the United States supported him in the war against Iran .
[unused1] [unused2] What we ' ##re talking about is the unpredictable nature of war and what could happen in this war .
[unused1] [unused2] For example - ##- wait a second - ##- in Iran , the reason that you had A ##ya ##to ##llah K ##hom ##ein ##i in power is he over ##th ##rew the Shah .
[unused1] [unused2] You who put the Shah in power ?
[unused1] [unused2] But the problem with K ##hom ##ein ##i was that the guy who he over ##th ##rew was put in power by the United States .
[unused1] [unused2] We over ##th ##rew - ##LR ##B ##- UN ##IN ##TE ##LL ##IG ##IB ##LE - ##R ##RB ##- and put the Shah of Iran in power .
[unused1] [unused2] But I mean you ' ##re attacking the CIA for putting him in , when it was - ##- the problem was K ##hom ##ein ##i .
[unused1] [unused2] You do n ##' ##t know what happens when the most powerful nation on Earth invade ##s and occupies a Muslim nation and kills tens of thousands of people .
[unused1] [unused2] And I ' ##m curious , how can Democrats claim that President Bush is ignoring the war on terror if al Qaeda ' ##s second key operative was just caught ?
[unused1] [unused2] The way we caught that guy was by coordinating with our allies .
[unused1] [unused2] The same weekend they arrested the guy , we had ...
[unused1] [unused2] We had no part in it .
[unused1] [unused2] No , it was a joint effort by Pakistan .
[unused1] [unused2] Why do we want to se ##ver that relationship with this idiot ##ic war in Iraq ?
[unused1] [unused2] The question of whether we go to war or not is strictly a national question .
[unused1] [unused2] On this Ash Wednesday , the pope asks Catholics to fast for peace and he asks President Bush to work for peace , while the White House sends out Colin Powell to make yet another case for war .
[unused1] [unused2] President Bush wants the Security Council to explicitly author ##ize force against Iraq , and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end , that ' ##s just what he ' ##ll get .
[unused1] [unused2] We do n ##' ##t need war .
[unused1] [unused2] They ' ##re not pointing out that inspection ##s are working only because there ' ##s the credible threat of war .
[unused1] [unused2] Saddam would n ##' ##t be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he did n ##' ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] It does n ##' ##t mean we have to go to war .
[unused1] [unused2] But I think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force .
[unused1] [unused2] It means when you take the threat of force of the table , you ' ##re likely to stop di ##sar ##ming Saddam Hussein .
[unused1] [unused2] Yes , I ' ##m not saying take the threat of force .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m saying we do n ##' ##t need to use force right now .
[unused1] [unused2] The essence of the American case for war against Saddam Hussein .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this : MS ##NBC , an obscure cable channel , has fired Phil Don ##ahu ##e , the host of its highest ##- ##rated show .
[unused1] [unused2] A me ##mo from inside NBC , reported on the Web site ally ##our ##t ##v ##. ##com , and today in ` ##` The Washington Post , ' ##' shows NBC big w ##ig ##s feared that the liberal Mr ##. Don ##ahu ##e represented in the words of the NBC me ##mo - ##- quote - ##- ` ##` a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war , while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti ##- ##war , anti ##- ##B ##ush and skeptical of the administration ' ##s motives . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Phil Don ##ahu ##e was fired because he ' ##s a liberal .
[unused1] [unused2] You know , you can argue back and forth , but you should n ##' ##t fire someone because of their political views and that ' ##s what NBC has done and shame on the General Electric corporation .
[unused1] [unused2] I used to work there .
[unused1] [unused2] ... but they should n ##' ##t fire a guy for his political views .
[unused1] [unused2] Former Illinois Senator Carol Mo ##sel ##ey ##- ##B ##ra ##un recently decided to run for president .
[unused1] [unused2] You become honorable by winning an election of some sort or having a high post , being an ambassador or a governor or some thing .
[unused1] [unused2] In a moment , we ' ##ll ask two members of Congress if they ' ##re convinced that war is the only way to make Saddam Hussein di ##sar ##m .
[unused1] [unused2] Later , the pope practices religion and a little anti ##- ##war politics on the side .
[unused1] [unused2] Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U ##. ##N ##. tomorrow to do what he can .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##re talking with potential war in Iraq with Congressman Charlie Range ##l , a New York Democrat and his fellow New Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King .
[unused1] [unused2] One of the reasons that we like having you on , and as well as Mr ##. Range ##l , is that , you know , this is war , as we were saying in the last segment .
[unused1] [unused2] You treat it with the gravity and the serious ##ness that it deserves .
[unused1] [unused2] Is n ##' ##t that wrong in a time of war ?
[unused1] [unused2] Congressman Range ##l , a couple of months ago Senator Das ##ch ##le on CBS said - ##- made the charge that we are , quote , ` ##` we have n ##' ##t made any real progress in the war against al Qaeda . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] If they do n ##' ##t have the pencil that ' ##s keeping score , they ought to keep their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor , every drug dealer I bust ##ed was the most important drug dealer in the world .
[unused1] [unused2] You just pass out numbers on whoever you arrest .
[unused1] [unused2] Because he helped plan the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ?
[unused1] [unused2] Let me tell you , when you arrest somebody , you describe who you ' ##re arrest ##ing .
[unused1] [unused2] Listen , we should be arrest ##ing a lot of people .
[unused1] [unused2] We should do all of those things , but the most important thing is we should not have the a ##rrogance to have a pre ##em ##pt ##ive strike against a defense ##less nation without the ...
[unused1] [unused2] And how ' ##d they get them ?
[unused1] [unused2] They have it and we supported them having it when they were fighting Iran so it ' ##s no big deal there .
[unused1] [unused2] And the thing is that if we can di ##sar ##m them without actually going there , killing them , I really think that we maintain our moral authority around the world .
[unused1] [unused2] I mean , what happens if India decides that they could have a pre ##em ##pt ##ive strike against Pakistan ?
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t think we have to kill to prove that .
[unused1] [unused2] One of the most admired men in the world is doing everything he can to a ##vert the horror of war .
[unused1] [unused2] Time now for ` ##` Fire ##back , ' ##' where our wa ##cky and k ##ook ##y fans and friends and critics right in .
[unused1] [unused2] Don from Denver , Colorado writes , ` ##` Paul , you keep refer ##encing Hall ##ib ##urt ##on selling equipment to Iraq ' ##' - ##- which I do .
[unused1] [unused2] What does that have to do with the war in Iraq ?
[unused1] [unused2] He ' ##s trying to lead us into a war against one of his valued customers .
[unused1] [unused2] But it has nothing to do whether we should go to war with Iraq or not .
[unused1] [unused2] Chad He ##nsley , from Fairfax , Virginia , writes , ` ##` France , Russia and German have all multi ##- ##bill ##ion dollar oil deals with Saddam in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] I wonder why they protest the war with Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds , but the U ##. ##S ##. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t believe for a minute that this is a war for oil .
[unused1] [unused2] I think it ' ##s un ##wise , it ' ##s un ##ju ##st , it ' ##s un ##war ##rant ##ed , but I do n ##' ##t think it ' ##s about oil .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , the reason that France , Russia and Germany are against war is because they have demo ##c ##rac ##ies .
[unused1] [unused2] The people are against it .
[unused1] [unused2] And I was just curious if you feel that the attack on Iraq would actually open a Pandora ' ##s box in other Middle Eastern countries that we are known to aid and harbor terrorists , such as Syria and Iran .
[unused1] [unused2] On the other hand , the region is pretty unstable , filled with people who already hate Americans and seek to do America harm .
[unused1] [unused2] And my question is , after today ' ##s meeting in Paris , where France , Russia and Germany decided to not back a second resolution , who is not - ##LR ##B ##- UN ##IN ##TE ##LL ##IG ##IB ##LE - ##R ##RB ##- ?
[unused1] [unused2] We know that some of the American troops now fighting in Iraq are longtime veterans of warfare , probably not most , but some .
[unused1] [unused2] So what is it like for them to face combat far from home ?
[unused1] [unused2] For an idea , here is CNN ' ##s Candy Crowley with some war stories .
[unused1] [unused2] There ' ##s nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat , because it is to kill people .
[unused1] [unused2] Staff Sergeant Tom Ridge opened fire .
[unused1] [unused2] A V ##iet Con ##g soldier dropped dead .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : Did you at the time or have you since looked back and pond ##ered on killing someone ?
[unused1] [unused2] Duke Cunningham was a Vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes .
[unused1] [unused2] And one of the guys looked at me and says : Duke , what ' ##s it like to kill somebody ?
[unused1] [unused2] And I went to the priest , because it bothered me .
[unused1] [unused2] I knew I could do it again .
[unused1] [unused2] But I did n ##' ##t know it was going to bother me as much as it did .
[unused1] [unused2] And it still does .
[unused1] [unused2] War may sometimes be a necessary thing , but it can never be a natural thing .
[unused1] [unused2] Sergeant Chuck Ha ##gel was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam .
[unused1] [unused2] You are trying to kill people , because the alternative is , if you are in combat , you will be killed .
[unused1] [unused2] Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you , going the other way .
[unused1] [unused2] Later , when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea , Staff Sergeant Charlie Range ##l led 40 men , fighting their way to safety .
[unused1] [unused2] If you ' ##re killing people , it ' ##s out of fear , not really , in my opinion , out of bravery .
[unused1] [unused2] Range ##l , Cunningham , Ridge and Ha ##gel are all proud , decorated combat veterans .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s just , a decade later , killing still troubles the soul .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : Did you do it again ?
[unused1] [unused2] I shot down four more MiG ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] They ' ##re expecting a total at this particular base near the Iraqi border of 300 sort ##ies in a 24 ##- ##hou ##r period ending today according to the Air Force total from all the bases and there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the Middle East according to the Pentagon .
[unused1] [unused2] They ' ##re saying there will be 1500 sort ##ies in a 24 ##- ##hou ##r period ending tomorrow .
[unused1] [unused2] Eight hundred of those sort ##ies will be strike sort ##ies using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in the amount of air power being used over Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , as coalition forces push north , they are encounter ##ing a unique problem of combat , getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy .
[unused1] [unused2] Some of the 40 ##, ##00 ##0 British troops are kicking up a lot of dust in the Iraqi desert making sure that nothing is left behind them that could hurt them .
[unused1] [unused2] And today ' ##s parts in this conflict , this kind of work becomes more and more important .
[unused1] [unused2] Today the Pentagon is comparing suicide bombing attacks on coalition forces in Iraq to terrorism .
[unused1] [unused2] Four U ##. ##S ##. Army soldiers were killed when a suicide bomber attacked a military check ##point today in Na ##ja ##f .
[unused1] [unused2] Four U ##. ##S ##. soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division man ##ning a check ##point near the town of Na ##ja ##f killed today in an apparent suicide bombing .
[unused1] [unused2] A man driving what appeared to be a taxi ##ca ##b came to the check ##point , waved soldiers over , appeared to be having mechanical problems of some kind .
[unused1] [unused2] As the soldiers approached , the man de ##ton ##ated explosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers .
[unused1] [unused2] This is something that Iraqi Vice President Rama ##dan had said would take place .
[unused1] [unused2] He said this long before the conflict ever began .
[unused1] [unused2] He re ##iter ##ated today in a press conference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on killing thousands of U ##. ##S ##. troops with suicide bombing similar to this .
[unused1] [unused2] Also , in southern Iraq today near Ba ##s ##ra , two members - claimed to be members of Saddam ' ##s That ##ae ##en - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- group surrendered to U ##. ##S ##. troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombings down there but that they did n ##' ##t want to die for the regime so they were surrender ##ing .
[unused1] [unused2] At the Pentagon brief ##ing today , General Stanley M ##c ##C ##hr ##ys ##tal said that it looked a lot like terrorism .
[unused1] [unused2] It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this , it requires strict ad ##herence or adjustments to your tactics , techniques and procedures to ensure that places like check ##points are not vulnerable .
[unused1] [unused2] No injuries reported .
[unused1] [unused2] The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radar ##s linked to surface to air missiles are still in ta ##ct .
[unused1] [unused2] They assure us that as soon as they do start turning on these radar ##s that they ' ##ll take those out too and finish the job in terms of airs ##pace over Baghdad ##. ##J ##ud ##y ...
[unused1] [unused2] You ' ##re looking at live pictures of Baghdad where there have been more strikes , more bombs dropped , more missiles this evening and of course as always , CNN keeping a close eye , a close watch , a close listen on what ' ##s going on in Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Since marching into Iraq , coalition troops have engaged in some fierce battles with Saddam Hussein ' ##s forces .
[unused1] [unused2] House clearance Royal Marine style , troops from - ##LR ##B ##- UN ##IN ##TE ##LL ##IG ##IB ##LE - ##R ##RB ##- command ##o task to seek out the last pockets of Iraqi resistance in Um ##m Q ##as ##r go in hard to arrest suspected regime s ##ym ##path ##izer ##s and search for weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] The Iraqi ##s arrested looked be ##mus ##ed - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- and plea ##d innocence but with many militia here , pretending to surrender only to open fire on their cap ##tors later , first impressions can be de ##ceptive and lethal .
[unused1] [unused2] A man in this vehicle took a pot shot at the command ##os .
[unused1] [unused2] It was a painful and bloody mistake .
[unused1] [unused2] We sent in one of our companies of about 100 men in here this morning and we took about 12 or 13 prisoners , three or four enemy were injured and they ' ##ve now been flown out and we ' ##re treating them including a man who is almost dead with a gunshot wound to the chest .
[unused1] [unused2] Ken Poll ##ack , that resistance that we just saw the British troops dealing with , you and I were talking earlier today .
[unused1] [unused2] The story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you ' ##re telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that .
[unused1] [unused2] Chance ##s are the Iraqi ##s are going to continue to stick with what we ' ##ve seen before , irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U ##. ##S ##. forces , some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , this is something that we ' ##ve been trying to get a grip on for years , exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqi ##s do , they des ##pis ##e .
[unused1] [unused2] They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token , they do n ##' ##t like another country coming into their country to over ##turn the government and beyond that , I think it ' ##s probably most important for most Iraqi ##s is they ' ##re deeply suspicious of the United States .
[unused1] [unused2] One last thing , Ken Poll ##ack I want to ask about this British officials saying that they have information that Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , if it ' ##s true and obviously we do n ##' ##t know just yet but if it ' ##s true , it is very significant because it ' ##s effectively the Iraqi ##s admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we ' ##ve seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas .
[unused1] [unused2] Exactly , in that market and I think it was pretty apparent when you looked at the video of that market , if that had been a U ##. ##S ##. bomb or a U ##. ##S ##. cruise missile , that market would have been o ##b ##lite ##rated .
[unused1] [unused2] Judy , you ' ##re seeing us through the night scope because basically for the last hour we ' ##ve been watching as this ridge behind me in Ka ##lak which of course is the front line between Iraq and Kurdish - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- forces , we ' ##ve been watching as planes , planes we can hear but can not see , have been bombing the ridge line behind us .
[unused1] [unused2] Five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the Iraqi positions behind us .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##ve also seen some massive blast ##s to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , basically on the ridge itself it is the most forward Iraqi army positions and we ' ##ve been watching them very closely for the last month prior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these are the positions that control this entire valley .
[unused1] [unused2] In addition to that , we know that further back behind those lines in the direction of Mo ##sul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well , this according to the people here in this area , the local Ku ##rds who have been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in smuggling .
[unused1] [unused2] Now precisely what they ' ##re hitting to the south of us is unclear but my understanding is that there are further Iraqi positions in that direction as well .
[unused1] [unused2] Ben We ##de ##man describing coalition hits in the area where he is , the town of Ka ##lak in northern Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] He just called in and we wanted to get this report to you right away .
[unused1] [unused2] When we come back , one of the many sad aspects of this war , humanitarian aid rushed to people who need it but not everybody gets what they came for .
[unused1] [unused2] As our convoy rolled through southern Iraq the desperation of the people here soon became evident .
[unused1] [unused2] In trucks and on foot they came to the town of Sa ##f ##wan .
[unused1] [unused2] These people have been without food or water supplies since the war began .
[unused1] [unused2] We hate any state in war here .
[unused1] [unused2] Del ##iver ##y drivers were threatened .
[unused1] [unused2] One of the buses in our convoy was held up at knife ##point .
[unused1] [unused2] The troops have moved into Sa ##f ##wan .
[unused1] [unused2] When we return , Americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of the troops .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##ll check out some of the demonstrations .
[unused1] [unused2] Here in the United States this weekend just as they did last weekend , anti ##- ##war protesters taking to the street .
[unused1] [unused2] In Los Angeles , the International Black Coalition for Peace and Justice is sponsor ##ing a rally for peace today .
[unused1] [unused2] In the meantime further north in California , San Francisco is the setting today for a rally aimed at boost ##ing the moral of the American troops in the Persian Gulf region .
[unused1] [unused2] Rusty , what sort of crowd is showing up there ?
[unused1] [unused2] Well Judy , this is the largest group really we ' ##ve seen of the support the troops rallies that have been over the last few weeks .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course this is the home of the anti ##- war demonstrations stem ##ming back to the Vietnam War but there are close to between 500 and 1 ##, ##00 ##0 people .
[unused1] [unused2] This has been a very peaceful demonstration .
[unused1] [unused2] As I said , the officers did tell me that this is the largest pro ##- ##tro ##ops demonstration that has ever been in San Francisco since the Vietnam War .
[unused1] [unused2] How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings ?
[unused1] [unused2] We get reports that these civilians especially in the - ##LR ##B ##- IN ##A ##U ##DI ##BL ##E - ##R ##RB ##- population have been attacked by the Iraqi regime themselves so they ca n ##' ##t blame the American and said look what the American doing to us .
[unused1] [unused2] Hopefully it will be a short war .
[unused1] [unused2] It will be attack the Iraqi regime .
[unused1] [unused2] This has been a very peaceful demonstration .
[unused1] [unused2] Be ##ssa ##m Al ##- ##H ##usa ##ini here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration .
[unused1] [unused2] It was in northern Iraq today that an eight artillery round hit the site occupied by Kurdish fighters near Cha ##m ##cha ##mal .
[unused1] [unused2] It happened near an area abandoned earlier by Iraqi forces .
[unused1] [unused2] A day ago it was controlled by Iraqi troops and packed with these land mines but now we can drive far enough to see the outskirts of Kirk ##uk .
[unused1] [unused2] That ' ##s because coalition fighter jets pu ##mme ##led this Iraqi position on the hills above Cha ##m ##cha ##mal and Iraqi troops made a has ##ty retreat .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m glad to see them go this one says .
[unused1] [unused2] They killed a lot of our people in Cha ##m ##cha ##mal but I feel bad for them too .
[unused1] [unused2] Some Ku ##rds took advantage of the Iraqi retreat right away .
[unused1] [unused2] Although the Iraqi ##s retreated from this area , at dusk they fired what observers say were seven artillery rounds back at their former stronghold creating new fear and potentially new casualties .
[unused1] [unused2] They talked by video ##phone this morning .
[unused1] [unused2] When we came across the bridge , the enemy launched some 155 artillery rounds at us .
[unused1] [unused2] It came pretty close and the concussion knocked my tooth out .
[unused1] [unused2] It was the first unit to cross the E ##up ##hra ##tes River and then punch northward to within 60 miles of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##ve had an absolutely te ##rri ##fic story , pushing forward north toward Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Seven ##ty ##- ##t ##wo hours of that was under constant fire coming at us from both sides of the road .
[unused1] [unused2] Re ##cal ##l Winston Churchill ' ##s old quote , ` ##` There ' ##s nothing so ex ##hil ##ara ##ting as being shot at and missed . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] We have under heavy fire for the past couple of miles .
[unused1] [unused2] Mostly small arms fire , but the sand storm has enabled the Iraqi ##s to come very close to the road , and if I sound a little nervous , it ' ##s because we ' ##re in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course , you ' ##re on an adrenaline high , but racing across the desert , you know that you ' ##re traveling toward the jaws of what could be a major military battle .
[unused1] [unused2] The U ##. ##S ##. Army ' ##s 7th Cavalry has just taken three Iraqi prisoners of war .
[unused1] [unused2] The Army is eating much , much better than the grandfather ##s of these soldiers did and the great grandfather ##s of these soldiers in the Second World War .
[unused1] [unused2] Just ahead we ' ##ll have the latest on today ' ##s suicide bombing in Israel .
[unused1] [unused2] We will be back later on the war in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] But first , we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks .
[unused1] [unused2] CNN ' ##s Kelly Wallace reports on today ' ##s attack in Net ##any ##a .
[unused1] [unused2] It had been very quiet inside Israel since the start of the U ##. ##s ##. ##- ##led war against Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Police say a suicide bomber blew himself up outside this cafe , called The London Cafe , earlier Sunday afternoon .
[unused1] [unused2] Many here though say they are relieved only one person dead , the suicide bomber .
[unused1] [unused2] Do ##zen ##s , though , injured , including some Israeli soldiers , because according to an eye ##wi ##t ##ness , he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the spring weather .
[unused1] [unused2] There had been many terrorist attacks here in Net ##any ##a , including the dead ##liest suicide bombing ever in Israel almost exactly a year ago , March 27 , at the Park Hotel during Pass ##over , 29 people killed in that attack .
[unused1] [unused2] As for this attack , the Palestinian militant group Islamic Ji ##had is claiming responsibility .
[unused1] [unused2] According to a leaf ##let from the group obtained by CNN , the group says the attack was to show the union of Palestinians with the people of Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] The group is also claiming that Islamic Ji ##had militants are already inside Iraq to carry out attacks against U ##. ##S ##. and British forces .
[unused1] [unused2] Israel has been on a heightened state of alert since the start of the U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led war against Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] And now many Israeli ##s fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against Saddam Hussein continues .
[unused1] [unused2] That ' ##s CNN ' ##s Karl Pen ##ha ##ul with the very latest from the battle ##front .
[unused1] [unused2] Military officials say 39 Americans have been killed in combat , 9 more by friendly fire or an accident .
[unused1] [unused2] Britain reports 6 of its troops have been killed by combat , 19 more in non ##hos ##tile action and 2 deaths have not been classified .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraq does not report on its military casualties , but Iraqi officials say 420 civilians have been killed and about 4 ##, ##00 ##0 injured .
[unused1] [unused2] Seven Americans remain prisoners of war in Iraq and 15 Americans are listed as missing in action .
[unused1] [unused2] Judy , in the next hour , on our special ` ##` W ##OL ##F B ##L ##IT ##Z ##ER R ##EP ##OR ##TS , ' ##' I ' ##m going to be speaking live to her older brother who is in the Army , her younger sister who wants to be in the Army , just around the same time as Jessica is going to be arriving at Rams ##tein , the air base in Germany for some serious medical treatment .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , at the Pentagon brief ##ing this afternoon , officials describing several units of the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting force .
[unused1] [unused2] Let ' ##s get the very latest from the Pentagon for the overall war picture as they see it .
[unused1] [unused2] Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously de ##graded those Republican Guard divisions before the U ##. ##S ##. troops arrived , both in Ka ##rb ##ala and also in Al Ku ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close in on Baghdad , this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so - called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons , and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon .
[unused1] [unused2] We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de main ##s , or anything like that .
[unused1] [unused2] So , in regard to that , we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground .
[unused1] [unused2] Additionally , their ability to use chemical and biological weapons , they ' ##ve proven it historically .
[unused1] [unused2] Clearly , as we threaten the core of the regime , which Baghdad and T ##ik ##rit represent , we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up .
[unused1] [unused2] In less than 24 hours , the U ##. ##S ##. 101 ##st Airborne Division has driven Iraqi Fed ##ay ##een fighters from the key city of Na ##ja ##f , pushed north in a several ##- ##p ##rong ##ed attack .
[unused1] [unused2] The Army ' ##s 3rd Infantry has punched through Ka ##rb ##ala , meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard , and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] At the same time , the Marines from the 1st Division have secured a key T ##ig ##ris River crossing near Al Ku ##t and reported to have essentially destroyed the combat fighting ability of that light infantry Baghdad division that was supposed to be providing defense down there .
[unused1] [unused2] He said , quote , ` ##` The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime now , and it will remain pointed at it , ' ##' he said , ` ##` until the regime is gone . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Jamie , these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin to bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago .
[unused1] [unused2] Could be urban combat .
[unused1] [unused2] Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] They also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed , they do n ##' ##t mean every single person has been killed .
[unused1] [unused2] Si ##mp ##ly that its combat effectiveness has been eliminated - Judy .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , rescued American prisoner of war Jessica Lynch is expected to arrive at Rams ##tein air base in Germany just about an hour from now .
[unused1] [unused2] CNN will have live coverage of her arrival .
[unused1] [unused2] Lynch was rescued in a daring raid by U ##. ##S ##. forces on the Saddam hospital in Na ##sir ##iya .
[unused1] [unused2] This nights ##cope video shows troops carrying the 19 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Army private to a Black ##hawk helicopter .
[unused1] [unused2] When she ' ##s in Germany , Lynch will be treated for bullet wounds and broken bones .
[unused1] [unused2] She and more than a dozen other members of her Army maintenance unit were ambushed near Na ##sir ##iya more than a week ago .
[unused1] [unused2] But they are doing a job , you know , I do n ##' ##t know the thoughts of the soldiers , the men and women that went into that building and brought her out .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##ll have more on the march toward Baghdad after a quick break .
[unused1] [unused2] We preview the potential battles ahead and the strategies in play when we check in with our military analyst .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. forces moving ever closer to Baghdad , but military officials say they are not counting on cap ##it ##ulation .
[unused1] [unused2] He ' ##s retired with the United States Army .
[unused1] [unused2] And besides , as soon as you get control of it you ' ##d be able to start using it for air operations , and put a survey team in there as soon as it ' ##s secured , and then start using it for helicopter operations , haul forward some big bladder ##s of fuel to re ##fu ##el helicopters and rear ##m them and things like that .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there are some big , wide divided highways there .
[unused1] [unused2] I would think , probably , various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government .
[unused1] [unused2] The Shia ##s are a bit gun shy , if you will , in the south because of what happened in 1991 .
[unused1] [unused2] They rose up , did n ##' ##t get American support .
[unused1] [unused2] Colonel Patrick Lang , retired , United states Army , thanks for your insights .
[unused1] [unused2] A man who has been to Baghdad many times and can tell us with great knowledge exactly what it ' ##s going to be like to fight on those avenue ##s in that sprawling city of Baghdad - Judy .
[unused1] [unused2] That means stocks were up today on Wall Street as they look at the progress of the war in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] As coalition forces push ahead in their march toward Baghdad , they have encountered some resistance in the Shi ##ite holy city of Ka ##rb ##ala .
[unused1] [unused2] But American troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key factor in the fighting there .
[unused1] [unused2] And to the south , British forces continue their attack on targets around Ba ##s ##ra .
[unused1] [unused2] These are soldiers of the U ##. ##S ##. 3rd Infantry , fighting near Ka ##rb ##ala , southwest of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] We will approach Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] British troops control the outskirts of the town , and today destroyed another building they said housed Iraqi fighters .
[unused1] [unused2] There is much fear here of the Saddam loyal ##ists who still hold sway in Ba ##s ##ra and of the invading troops waiting at the gates .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : The Americans are racing towards Baghdad , the British still seem anxious to make their progress here as measured as possible .
[unused1] [unused2] But there may first be fighting in the capital , 250 miles to the north .
[unused1] [unused2] From the south to the north in the rolling hills of northern Iraq , coalition air strikes targeted Iraqi positions today in what ' ##s been called a f ##ero ##cious bombardment .
[unused1] [unused2] It happened outside the oil ##- ##rich city of Kirk ##uk .
[unused1] [unused2] This land fell into Iraqi ##- ##K ##ur ##dis ##h hands without a shot being fired .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry , under the on ##sla ##ught of coalition bombing .
[unused1] [unused2] We are now between the lines , a no man ' ##s land of abandoned Iraqi bunker ##s and an un ##ner ##ving silence , broken by the roar of war ##planes and the distant surge of air strikes .
[unused1] [unused2] And , says the Iraqi opposition , in winning this war .
[unused1] [unused2] With U ##. ##S ##. forces rolling closer and closer to Baghdad , the military seems to be zero ##ing in on the ground war .
[unused1] [unused2] But , as it has from the beginning , air power remains an important part of the battle .
[unused1] [unused2] In two weeks after the air war began , there is no let ##- ##up and no effective response from the Iraqi ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] According to the Air Force , at any given time , there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over Iraq , flying to Iraq or flying from Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] We can tell you that a lot of pilots of this base are not flying to another base in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s a base that was taken over by the coalition last week .
[unused1] [unused2] And when you arrive there , you are greeted in a sense by Saddam Hussein .
[unused1] [unused2] But the are no more Iraqi ##s here , the coalition took over this base last week .
[unused1] [unused2] What ' ##s happen is the military personnel who have arrived here have taken out their markers and are writing messages on Saddam Hussein ' ##s portrait .
[unused1] [unused2] There is a lot of fighting in this area .
[unused1] [unused2] After he told us that , we asked him during his missions , and he ' ##s flown about 30 in the last two weeks , we asked him does he still have any artillery being fired at him ?
[unused1] [unused2] Yesterday I was up just south of Baghdad by 30 miles and we were fighting SA ##- ##2 ##s and SA ##- ##6 ##s and AAA on the ground .
[unused1] [unused2] But the air power and the air package that we take to the fight , we continue to be effective .
[unused1] [unused2] And when we put our power punch to them and then the Army and the Marines move forward it ' ##s a very effective , coordinated effort .
[unused1] [unused2] We want to tell you the Air Force has just informed us that between this morning and tomorrow morning , it will fly 1 ##, ##90 ##0 sort ##ies into Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] That air base that coalition forces have now taken control of near Na ##sir ##iya .
[unused1] [unused2] What they are doing , Judy , some of these A ##- ##10 ##s behind me go there to re ##fu ##el , to stage operations further north .
[unused1] [unused2] I will be talking with a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Senator Joe B ##iden , just ahead , for his take on how the war is going .
[unused1] [unused2] With the power out now in Baghdad , we ' ##re getting word that loud ##sp ##eak ##ers have been b ##lar ##ing in the Iraqi capital , urging citizens to go to the international airport there , presumably to defend it against coalition forces .
[unused1] [unused2] Now that armored columns of U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led troops have reached the outskirts of Baghdad , eye ##wi ##t ##ness ##es report fighting and shell ##ing around Saddam Hussein International Airport .
[unused1] [unused2] In the final push to Baghdad , U ##. ##S ##. forces face limited resistance from Iraqi troops .
[unused1] [unused2] But the Pentagon believes some Iraqi Republican Guard units have withdrawn to the capital for what could be their last stand .
[unused1] [unused2] Far ##ther south in Ba ##s ##ra , smoke rose over the city as coalition vehicles moved in today .
[unused1] [unused2] And in northern Iraq , Kurdish political leaders and members of the Iraqi opposition are engaged in talks with U ##. ##S ##. military commanders .
[unused1] [unused2] Coalition forces launched their latest advances toward Baghdad in the pre ##- ##da ##wn hours today , heading toward the Iraqi capital from the southeast and the southwest .
[unused1] [unused2] The forces encountered limited resistance along the way and are now poised for the final assault not far from the edge of the city .
[unused1] [unused2] Baghdad is now within striking distance as troops make their final thrust through the desert .
[unused1] [unused2] But by and large , the Republican Guard has either been destroyed or has withdrawn .
[unused1] [unused2] And the way seems to be open for coalition forces to close in on the city ' ##s southern limits .
[unused1] [unused2] At day ##break , U ##. ##S ##. troops pushed through the outskirts of Ka ##rb ##ala on the road to Baghdad , capturing a key bridge on the E ##up ##hra ##tes River .
[unused1] [unused2] These dramatic pictures show a raid on a presidential palace less than 60 miles from Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] We do n ##' ##t think that the fighting is over yet , and so there are still options available to the regime , including the use of weapons of mass destruction .
[unused1] [unused2] The Americans say they ' ##ve destroyed two divisions of the elite Republican Guard .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : The Medina division , which is one of the tough ##est outfits in the Republican Guard is now down to 10 percent of its fighting strength .
[unused1] [unused2] Others are down to 50 percent , but there ' ##s still one or two divisions around 75 , 80 , 90 percent of their fighting strength , and they could still put up very stiff resistance , indeed , when the American forces get en mass ##e to Baghdad itself .
[unused1] [unused2] Armed coalition soldiers moving toward a ve ##ner ##ated mosque at the be ##hes ##t of a Muslim c ##ler ##ic .
[unused1] [unused2] Also , we have heard and seen reports that she had multiple gunshot wounds , and knife stabbing .
[unused1] [unused2] He looked for the gunshot wounds for the knife stabbing , and there is no injury whatsoever .
[unused1] [unused2] She has fractured legs and her right forearm .
[unused1] [unused2] If those were n ##' ##t gunshot wounds to cause the broken bones , do they know what caused the fracture ##s ?
[unused1] [unused2] They have no idea at this time what caused them .
[unused1] [unused2] Can you tell us what she said to you on the telephone ?
[unused1] [unused2] They did go on to say the doctors could not find either bullet or knife entry wounds , suggesting that her broken bones came from some other source , and it is not clear yet .
[unused1] [unused2] Her parents said they do n ##' ##t know yet what caused their daughter ' ##s injuries .
[unused1] [unused2] Armed coalition soldiers moving toward a ve ##ner ##ated mosque at the request of a Muslim c ##ler ##ic , but angry locals who did n ##' ##t understand what they were trying to do .
[unused1] [unused2] Any ##body could be an inform ##er and punish us for talking to you , even my family , he tells me in Arabic .
[unused1] [unused2] Word comes from the grand A ##ya ##to ##llah Si ##stan ##i that he ' ##s willing to meet the American commander , but he asks first for soldiers to secure his compound , located halfway down the road to the mosque .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- voice ##- ##over - ##R ##RB ##- : Chaos as the crowd apparently believes the soldiers want to approach the shrine .
[unused1] [unused2] They want to get inside the holy shrine of Imam Ali .
[unused1] [unused2] He orders his men back to their compound to a ##wai ##t cooler heads .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , U ##. ##S ##. officials are investigating two possible friendly fire incidents in which coalition forces may have mistakenly shot at allied aircraft .
[unused1] [unused2] In one of the incidents , a soldier was killed and several others wounded .
[unused1] [unused2] Before word of that death , 40 Americans had been killed by hostile fire in Operation Iraqi Freedom .
[unused1] [unused2] Eleven of them by friendly fire or in other accidents .
[unused1] [unused2] Most of the 27 British troops killed have been victims of friendly fire or accidents .
[unused1] [unused2] Mean ##time , Iraq says that 420 civilians , they say , have been killed during the war .
[unused1] [unused2] And they say 4 ##, ##00 ##0 injured .
[unused1] [unused2] Seven Americans we know remain prisoners of war in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , when they do finally enter Baghdad , U ##. ##S ##. and coalition troops could face urban combat with the Republican Guard , some of whom may have withdrawn into the city .
[unused1] [unused2] And Colonel Leon ##hard , we ' ##re going to talk a little bit about urban combat .
[unused1] [unused2] And I wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat , they think of that Black ##hawk down scenario , Mo ##ga ##dis ##hu and the problems that can go wrong here .
[unused1] [unused2] We are much more likely to use patience and fines ##se rather than assault tactics .
[unused1] [unused2] If we move in on Baghdad , and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s the side that ' ##s moving that ' ##s going to take the casualties .
[unused1] [unused2] That said , the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they ' ##re moving a little bit faster as than we probably will .
[unused1] [unused2] And then we ' ##ll probably surge fires into their both lethal and non ##let ##hal to make his position un ##ten ##able , to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone .
[unused1] [unused2] At which time we can engage them or arrest them .
[unused1] [unused2] Typically , when they ' ##d assault a target like this , they ' ##d do what ?
[unused1] [unused2] G ##ra ##vity rules , even in urban combat .
[unused1] [unused2] Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard , we appreciate your insights in urban combat , something that is not something that the U ##. ##S ##. military would prefer to engage in , but it might become inevitable .
[unused1] [unused2] President Bush vows a final push to victory and he m ##our ##ns the loss of fallen Marines .
[unused1] [unused2] Up next , a report on the president ' ##s trip to Camp Le ##je ##une , and a look at how the Camp Le ##je ##une community is cop ##ing with the challenges of war .
[unused1] [unused2] New explosions rock Baghdad after dark .
[unused1] [unused2] Witness ##es say they heard blast ##s around a presidential complex in the center of the city .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , the latest on the fight for control of Baghdad ' ##s International Airport .
[unused1] [unused2] IT ##N reporter James Mat ##es was with the U ##. ##S ##. forces when they moved in to secure the airport .
[unused1] [unused2] These pictures were taken on the runway just moments after the coalition attack .
[unused1] [unused2] It lies just 12 miles from Baghdad and will be a key forward base for U ##. ##S ##. troops as they prepare for a push on the capital .
[unused1] [unused2] More than 300 Iraqi soldiers have been left dead .
[unused1] [unused2] Some Republican Guard troops fought fiercely on the northern side of the airport complex .
[unused1] [unused2] Outside the airport , the fighting was fierce , but the battle une ##qua ##l .
[unused1] [unused2] But the final push into the city could yet prove to be the tough ##est fighting of all .
[unused1] [unused2] Have they done so much damage now to Iraqi command and control centers that they can no longer put up a proper fight , or are the best troops simply withdrawing into the city , to fight there street by street ?
[unused1] [unused2] The answer to that could well decide how quickly they make a final push into the city .
[unused1] [unused2] Attack ##ing on the ground and calling in air strikes , Kurdish fighters and U ##. ##S ##. troops have di ##s ##lo ##dged stubborn Iraqi soldiers at a key bridge in northern Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] A few miles further to Mo ##sul , Kurdish militia and their flags speeding to a town abandoned by Iraqi forces .
[unused1] [unused2] After a day of fighting , the Iraqi ##s were driven back five kilometers , about three miles down the main road west towards Mo ##sul from the Kurdish city of E ##rb ##il .
[unused1] [unused2] Soldiers were Kurdish , but the special forces calling in air strikes on Iraqi positions were American .
[unused1] [unused2] As U ##. ##S ##. war ##planes dropped bombs near the town , Kurdish fighters moved forward .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : There ' ##s a slow ##- ##and ##- ##stead ##y battle going on here for control of the key bridge .
[unused1] [unused2] The Iraqi ##s are firing artillery like that in response to the Americans are calling in air strikes .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- voice ##- ##over - ##R ##RB ##- : That blast turned out to be a rocket ##- ##p ##rop ##elle ##d grenade , but there ' ##s plenty of artillery and mortar fire to come .
[unused1] [unused2] Are you coming here ?
[unused1] [unused2] Less than 20 minutes later , with Iraqi defenses pounded by the bombing , they no longer held the bridge over the K ##hos ##er River .
[unused1] [unused2] It was either shell ##ed or bombed .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , it ' ##s a small part of this battle for the bridge just behind us .
[unused1] [unused2] And one of them , not from our CNN , but from a very close friend of all of ours , Michael Kelly , paid that price .
[unused1] [unused2] The first American embedded journalist to have gotten killed in covering this war .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , at least three U ##. ##S ##. service members were killed today in an apparent suicide bomb attack at a check ##point near the Had ##ita ##h Dam northwest of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Those deaths are not yet included in the official casual ##ty count .
[unused1] [unused2] At last report , though , 41 Americans had been killed by hostile forces , 13 others by friendly fire or in accidents .
[unused1] [unused2] Of the 27 British troops , in all who have been killed , at least 19 of them were said to be victims of friendly fire or accidents .
[unused1] [unused2] The official Iraqi casual ##ty figures remain the same this day , including more than 400 civilians killed , Iraqi authorities say .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , funeral services were held today in Colorado for 21 ##- ##ye ##ar - old Marine Corporal Randall Kent Rosa ##cker .
[unused1] [unused2] He was killed in action in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] He received word of his son ' ##s death within hours after the submarine that he was assigned to returned home from an extended deployment .
[unused1] [unused2] The Iraqi ##s promise an unconventional attack on U ##. ##S ##. troops tonight .
[unused1] [unused2] Do they mean g ##uer ##illa warfare , as in Vietnam ?
[unused1] [unused2] Well , as coalition forces push ahead in their bid to capture Baghdad , big questions remain about Saddam Hussein and his whereabouts .
[unused1] [unused2] It is still not clear , looking at the latest tapes of the Iraqi president , whether he ' ##s dead or alive .
[unused1] [unused2] CNN senior international correspondent Ni ##c Robertson , who was expelled from Baghdad , is with us now from the border of Iraq and Jordan , on the Jordan ##ian side , to talk about what ' ##s happening in the Iraqi capital .
[unused1] [unused2] Ni ##c , we ' ##re getting information in bits and pieces about the in ##cursion by coalition land forces , about air flights over the city .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , from what we hear from sources in Baghdad this evening , it had been mostly quiet in terms of bombing throughout the day in Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Then there was a large explosion not far from the hotel journalists are staying in in the center of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , Iraq ' ##s minister of information today said that the coalition did not have control of the airport , that this was some sort of con ##tri ##ved video from the first day , and that , in fact , hundreds of coalition soldiers had been killed , and their graves were now at the airport .
[unused1] [unused2] He did promise to take journalists to the airport , however , he never made - ##- he did n ##' ##t make good on that promise throughout the day .
[unused1] [unused2] The information minister also read a statement from President Saddam Hussein today , the Iraqi leader calling on people to be re ##sol ##ute , to be strong , and saying that if they put up a good fight , then the coalition would eventually back down .
[unused1] [unused2] But to harm the enemy more and more , go against the enemy and destroy the enemy and follow the plans that you got in writing .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , representatives of the committee - ##- the International Committee for the Red Cross , who have been to some of the hospitals in Baghdad , report higher ##- ##than ##- ##us ##ual numbers of casualties coming into those hospitals .
[unused1] [unused2] We had a chance in the morning to go to the main hospital , which is called Ya ##rm ##uk - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- , and we found there has been a steady flow in of hundreds of casualties , all over the night and through into the day , casualties - ##- I mean , war wounded had to be sent over , dispatched to other hospitals , because this Ya ##rm ##uk was just totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of people coming in .
[unused1] [unused2] And Iraqi officials promise to take journalists to this particular hospital , the Ya ##rm ##uk Hospital , that is now located , it ' ##s on the southwest of Baghdad , and it appears to be pretty much between the position of where coalition forces have been seen and where Iraq now has a mi ##lit ##ari ##zed front ##- ##line position .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , when journalists were taken to see that hospital , twice they were turned around and told that they were n ##' ##t actually allowed to go inside that hospital , Judy .
[unused1] [unused2] It is a garden - ##- it is a large garden ##- ##type area for people to take their children to go and play .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , as American forces do push ahead toward the Iraqi government ' ##s key center of power , British forces are keeping up their work to the south of the Iraqi capital .
[unused1] [unused2] IT ##N reporter Juliet B ##rem ##ner is embedded with British forces in Iraq ' ##s second ##- ##lar ##ges ##t city , Ba ##s ##ra , where the fight for control goes on .
[unused1] [unused2] By the time they leave Iraq , they ' ##re determined Saddam and his Ba ##' ##ath Party will have bitten the dust .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : They ' ##re well within striking distance of the mortar ##s and rockets of the Fed ##ay ##een militia , but they ' ##re prepared to take that risk to try and persuade the people of Ba ##s ##ra that they w ##o n ##' ##t desert them , that they ' ##ll stick with this however messy it gets .
[unused1] [unused2] We watched a night ##time raid on the homes of Ba ##' ##ath Party officials and Fed ##ay ##een militia .
[unused1] [unused2] There was no shots fired .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##ve been playing warnings to people to stay in their houses , and we ' ##ve only lifted those people we ' ##ve got very good intelligence on .
[unused1] [unused2] Up next , evidence at a makeshift m ##or ##gue points to mass executions by the Iraqi regime .
[unused1] [unused2] But first , more scenes from today ' ##s fighting in Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , U ##. ##S ##. forces entering Baghdad do face the prospect of urban combat , a type of battle they have trained for , but , of course , they would prefer to avoid .
[unused1] [unused2] For more now on the unique challenges posed by urban combat , let ' ##s go back to Atlanta and join the man whose voice we just heard , Miles O ##' ##B ##rien .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m joined by J ##. Kelly M ##c ##C ##ann , our security analyst , a man who ' ##s spent a lot of time learning about urban combat .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##re going to kind of play it and stop it , and Kelly ' ##s going to walk us through , I guess , Urban Combat 101 .
[unused1] [unused2] Go ahead and stop the tape ##. ##As you make every entry , Miles , there are two dead spots , one , of course , in this direction right here , which you ca n ##' ##t see from the doorway , the other in this direction right here , and that ' ##s always the problem , because as you come in here , you ' ##ve got to be able to get in there quickly and make sure that this person here does n ##' ##t get shot in the back .
[unused1] [unused2] You ' ##ll see another person come right up here , and he ' ##ll hold on this door , because that ' ##s not been cleared space yet , again , straight trigger finger , but ready to shoot if he needs to .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , this is a rural setting , but this could be applied to urban combat , yes .
[unused1] [unused2] Same thing when you come into a building .
[unused1] [unused2] You see them having their sectors of fire .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s not clear how long the bodies had la ##in here , but they were clearly not from this war .
[unused1] [unused2] You come to expect everything in war fighting .
[unused1] [unused2] Most had died from gunshot wounds to the head .
[unused1] [unused2] Others were m ##uti ##lated beyond recognition , their faces burned and swollen .
[unused1] [unused2] De ##fin ##ite ##ly put up a fight .
[unused1] [unused2] These could take out a Jeep or a Hu ##m ##ve ##e in a heartbeat .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s - ##- yes , it ' ##s extremely dangerous , because once you enter these buildings , we found , actually , enemy , you know , guarding these sites .
[unused1] [unused2] And we have the capability to send pictures or actual video , and then they can make - ##LR ##B ##- UN ##IN ##TE ##LL ##IG ##IB ##LE - ##R ##RB ##- if they want to maybe avoid that area or go ahead and go out and engage those folks .
[unused1] [unused2] Do ##dging missiles and triple ##- ##A fire is something new to this squadron .
[unused1] [unused2] They ' ##ve just come across one of the Marine convoys that they need to track , so they ' ##re watching every move that the Marines make as they move towards Baghdad , making sure they do n ##' ##t come across any type of threat .
[unused1] [unused2] ... making sure they do n ##' ##t get ambushed .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##ll look at the routes ahead of where our guys are going to go and try to see what enemy is there .
[unused1] [unused2] When you ' ##re on the ground fighting , every piece of information you ' ##ve got about what you ' ##re coming up against is golden .
[unused1] [unused2] And one more safe Marine is one more Marine that can continue on north to Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Coming up , we are going to go live to Fort Bliss , where the name of that base is a far cry from the mood there today , after confirmation that more of their own were killed on the battlefield .
[unused1] [unused2] An apparent friendly fire incident in northern Iraq is taking more of a toll on Kurdish leaders than we knew at first .
[unused1] [unused2] Eight ##een people are now reported dead .
[unused1] [unused2] It is another friendly fire disaster .
[unused1] [unused2] This morning , an American bomb destroyed a convoy carrying high officials of the Kurdish P ##esh ##mer ##ga forces , which have been fighting alongside the Americans on the northern front .
[unused1] [unused2] At least 17 Kurdish commanders and their guards were killed , along with an interpreter working for the BBC .
[unused1] [unused2] More than 40 were injured .
[unused1] [unused2] The military chief of the Kurdish K ##DP , the brother of their leader , Mass ##ud Bar ##zan ##i - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- , was gravel ##y hurt .
[unused1] [unused2] The idea was to open the way with heavy sustained American bombing of Iraqi positions .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- voice ##- ##over - ##R ##RB ##- : Even as we filmed the wreckage , U ##. ##S ##. jets were still dropping their bombs nearby .
[unused1] [unused2] Giant explosions erupted down the road .
[unused1] [unused2] Then , as the Ku ##rds advanced again , the Iraqi ##s opened up .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : Now we ' ##re hearing the boom of Iraqi guns as they fire towards our positions .
[unused1] [unused2] All morning , the Ku ##rds have been trying to advance , and that was the shell going off .
[unused1] [unused2] Here in the north , Iraqi tanks and guns are still firing , and the American effort is looking a little ragged .
[unused1] [unused2] Letter writing , you know , is sometimes called a lost art in this age of electronic communication .
[unused1] [unused2] Karl Pen ##ha ##ul is with an Army attack helicopter battalion in the town of Na ##ja ##f in southeastern Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] War , soldiers say , is long hours of bored ##om , followed by a few moments of madness .
[unused1] [unused2] No phones , no e ##- ##mail , letters are the only link to home .
[unused1] [unused2] Mel ##ony Marshall was married just a month before she left for Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] I have n ##' ##t received mail in two days .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m ready to come home .
[unused1] [unused2] When I get home , I do n ##' ##t want to see a camera .
[unused1] [unused2] I just want to come home . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Attack pilot John Davis is feeling sad he ' ##s missing seeing his children grow up .
[unused1] [unused2] Perhaps I can do better when I get home . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Tiffany O ##' ##N ##eal , a military cook , vent ##s her frustration about the rig ##ors of desert warfare to a friend .
[unused1] [unused2] In his previous letter home , Apache pilot Joe B ##ru ##hl did n ##' ##t tell his family the full details about his first combat mission .
[unused1] [unused2] We did receive heavy fire and many of our aircraft took significant hits , including mine .
[unused1] [unused2] I tell you all this not to worry you , but to give you comfort knowing what you hear and see is true and that , despite that , I am safe and will continue to be .
[unused1] [unused2] Different ranks , different an ##xi ##eti ##es , but all are hoping , by the time their letters get back to the U ##. ##S ##. , they too will soon be heading home .
[unused1] [unused2] And , as we listened to John King ' ##s report , we can tell you that President Bush has just - ##- his plane has just landed at Andrews Air Force Base , just close to the Washington area , the president having flown back to the United States from that meeting in Northern Ireland in Belfast with the British prime minister , Tony Blair .
[unused1] [unused2] They primarily talked about the war in Iraq , the aftermath of Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] But they also discussed the Middle East and , as well , getting the Northern Ireland peace process started up again .
[unused1] [unused2] What was to follow was a horrific education in terror and torture : in the smoking basement of the bombed building , a war ##ren of cells .
[unused1] [unused2] Here , prisoners were tortured .
[unused1] [unused2] People died .
[unused1] [unused2] People died , people in prison without court , without trial .
[unused1] [unused2] So many people come here , but we do n ##' ##t know about them at all .
[unused1] [unused2] These ordinary Iraqi ##s had been terrified to come here , until today , though one student on the left had been here before .
[unused1] [unused2] These men had relatives murdered here .
[unused1] [unused2] The hook in the ceiling is for one purpose only , another hook in a different cell and a different form of torture .
[unused1] [unused2] Saddam Hussein controlled Iraq through fear , torture and execution .
[unused1] [unused2] Ham ##id Fat ##il - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- may look like he ' ##s acting , but he was tortured here , along with his two brothers , who were executed .
[unused1] [unused2] They sentenced him to death .
[unused1] [unused2] And they sent him to Baghdad and killed .
[unused1] [unused2] He was hanged there , hanged .
[unused1] [unused2] The hundreds or thousands who died here who were given no trial , no voice , cry out .
[unused1] [unused2] No one knows yet whether the new Iraq will be the kind of place where these children can grow up free of the fear , the horror of torture .
[unused1] [unused2] Journalists killed in the line of duty in Baghdad - ##- how neutral are reporters in a war supposed to be ?
[unused1] [unused2] Well , the journalists ' death raise questions about the tactics of U ##. ##S ##. troops trying to take control of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] They also serve as a reminder that many of our colleagues covering this war are putting their lives on the line every day .
[unused1] [unused2] When an Al - J ##az ##eera reporter was killed today , the network charged it had been targeted by U ##. ##S ##. force .
[unused1] [unused2] Central Command said , no , its forces were trading fire from a hotel where the network was housed .
[unused1] [unused2] At a nearby hotel , two other journalists , a photographer from Re ##uters and another from Tel ##e 5 Spain died , another case , CE ##NT ##CO ##M says , of coalition forces returning fire .
[unused1] [unused2] A Kurdish journalist died in a U ##. ##S ##. friendly ##- ##fire accident in the north .
[unused1] [unused2] And an American writer ##/ ##ed ##itor , ` ##` Washington Post ' ##' editorial columnist Michael Kelly , was killed when his Hu ##m ##ve ##e plunged into a canal while e ##va ##ding Iraqi fire .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : It is an elementary fact of life during wartime : A press pass provides no protection .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- voice ##- ##over - ##R ##RB ##- : Fame ##d World War II reporter Ernie P ##yle was killed by a sniper on an island in the Pacific .
[unused1] [unused2] Fame ##d combat photographer Robert Cap ##a , who took a classic photo of a fighter ' ##s death during the Spanish Civil War , himself died from a land mine in Indo ##china .
[unused1] [unused2] More than 65 journalists of many national ##ities died in Southeast Asia .
[unused1] [unused2] ABC News producer David Kaplan was killed by sniper fire in the Balkans in 1992 .
[unused1] [unused2] Sometimes reporters , like ` ##` The Wall Street Journal ' ##' ' ##s Danny Pearl , die in covering a different kind of war .
[unused1] [unused2] Pearl was murdered by terrorists in Pakistan .
[unused1] [unused2] The casual ##ty count helps put the ongoing debate about journalist ##ic neutrality into a sharp ##er light .
[unused1] [unused2] The 600 journalists embedded with American troops in Iraq will be threatened by the same fire as the troops they are covering .
[unused1] [unused2] N ##eu ##tral ##ity in a fire ##fight ?
[unused1] [unused2] Are they supposed to be neutral on the outcome of the war ?
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : Now , none of this means journalists will ignore un ##sett ##ling news : military set ##backs , lack of supplies , the in ##f ##lic ##tion of civilian casualties .
[unused1] [unused2] Reporter ##s who ignore or di ##sto ##rt facts are betray ##ing their craft no matter what and no matter how much that may anger the people running a war .
[unused1] [unused2] And tonight on ` ##` LA ##R ##R ##Y K ##ING L ##IVE , ' ##' Al ##- ##J ##az ##eera correspondent Omar Al Is ##sa ##wi will talk to Larry about the death of his colleague and the continuing p ##light of journalists in a war zone .
[unused1] [unused2] Just now , we want to show you scenes from Andrews Air Force Base just moments ago , President Bush returning to the United States from his summit in Northern Ireland in Belfast with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , the president back on American soil after a quick two ##- ##day trip , less than two ##- ##day trip to Belfast , he and the prime minister discussing , of course , the war in Iraq , what happens after , as well as the peace process in the Middle East , and restart ##ing the peace process in Northern Ireland .
[unused1] [unused2] The president then climbed aboard Marine One , the helicopter , heading back to the White House , where he will arrive pretty soon .
[unused1] [unused2] Still ahead : How is the world react ##ing to the war in Iraq ?
[unused1] [unused2] The United States Navy and Coast Guard crews are providing port security in the Persian Gulf during the Iraq war .
[unused1] [unused2] And one group of sailors is getting letters from elementary school children in North Carolina .
[unused1] [unused2] It started as a story on port security , how U ##. ##S ##. Navy and Coast Guard reserves are keeping ships safe from attack in Kuwait and Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- voice ##- ##over - ##R ##RB ##- : But among the boats , guns , radar , son ##ar and communications , we found a secret weapon posted on the side of the tent that serves as the command center : letters from second ##- ##grade ##rs .
[unused1] [unused2] He was sent over right next to the Persian Gulf now since New Year ' ##s Eve .
[unused1] [unused2] Her second ##- ##grade ##rs were very interested in sending some letters out to the troops .
[unused1] [unused2] When the war starts , your heart will be in our souls . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] For these kids to takes time to read letters to us and stuff like that in their class , what more can you ask ?
[unused1] [unused2] There will be more letters on the way .
[unused1] [unused2] You might want to mention that in your letter as well .
[unused1] [unused2] This time , they hope the sailors will write back with answers to their questions .
[unused1] [unused2] We started work on our letters the last week of February and worked on them the first week of March and sent them out a few weeks ago .
[unused1] [unused2] And they got the letters pretty quickly over there .
[unused1] [unused2] And thank you very much to your students for all the support and the letters that they sent out to us .
[unused1] [unused2] Those letters important at both ends .
[unused1] [unused2] Yesterday , there were scenes of j ##ubi ##lation in Baghdad , today , a suicide bombing and firefighters , grim reminder ##s that , as U ##. ##S ##. Central Command put it , Baghdad is still an ugly place .
[unused1] [unused2] When a car fails to stop , it ' ##s the cue for a violent gun battle .
[unused1] [unused2] These thieves are trying to flee the German Embassy , having been shot at by a guard .
[unused1] [unused2] It is a huge sigh of relief , because it could have been much worse and Baghdad could have been a war theater with more destruction to property .
[unused1] [unused2] In other parts of Iraq , I received with great sadness the killing of one close colleague , Sa ##eed Abu Na ##ji A ##b ##hu ##ey - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- in Na ##ja ##f .
[unused1] [unused2] He was not killed by former members of the Ba ##ath Party or the security of the army , but by just a local organized group .
[unused1] [unused2] And , particularly , I have in mind the Iraqi National Congress that Mr ##. Cha ##la ##bi , who was assisted by U ##. ##S ##. forces in getting back into Iraq ?
[unused1] [unused2] Unfortunately , we do not have a national group that can appeal to Iraqi ##s as Iraqi ##s within a credible voice ##. ##T ##his needs to be constructed , maybe through a conference to be held in Baghdad , where representatives from provinces all over Iraq need to participate , as well as political groups .
[unused1] [unused2] Up next : a live report on that ceremony and the latest efforts to pass a spending bill to pay for the war .
[unused1] [unused2] A reminder , Jessica Lynch coming back to the United States within the hour .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , his tenure at the United Nations is over , too .
[unused1] [unused2] Last night before leaving the United States , Al ##do ##uri said he hopes to see free elections in a free Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] CNN ' ##s Richard Roth has more on this once prominent frontman for the Iraqi regime .
[unused1] [unused2] But now , it ' ##s the Iraqi ambassador ' ##s time to leave , the United States .
[unused1] [unused2] But he never got comfortable in the media glare before and especially during the war .
[unused1] [unused2] Al ##do ##uri also drew support from opponents of the war a gift of paper crane ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Al ##do ##uri was in better spirits as he departed for the airport with a final message .
[unused1] [unused2] I hope that the United States Army will leave Iraq soon , and we will have free election for a free government for a free future for Iraq and the people for Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] CNN medical correspondent , Dr ##. San ##jay Gupta , has been traveling with the Devil Doc ##s throughout the war and now they are close to Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] For others , the stories can be seen in their injuries .
[unused1] [unused2] Even while statutes were coming down and there was dancing in the streets , the consequences of continuing fire ##fight ##s are seen here .
[unused1] [unused2] Corps ##men quickly take patients by ambulance away from the blowing sand to a t ##ria ##ge tent .
[unused1] [unused2] Over 45 minutes as we watched , 32 patients were delivered here , evaluated and nine operations started ; 29 of those delivered , Marines involved in a fire ##fight in the center of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Their stories could be seen in the s ##hra ##p ##nel wounds of rocket ##- ##p ##rop ##elle ##d grenades and bullet wounds from semi ##- ##aut ##oma ##tic weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] The people of T ##ik ##rit are saying Saddam ' ##s family left that city three days ago , well before the Americans arrived .
[unused1] [unused2] Saddam ' ##s clan is said to have left for a small village in the desert .
[unused1] [unused2] She wants to call her pregnant daughter Sa ##ba - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- in Sweden to see if she has delivered .
[unused1] [unused2] He wants to call his mom in Houston .
[unused1] [unused2] On this one sidewalk in Baghdad , they were all doing the most natural thing during war , trying to reach their loved ones .
[unused1] [unused2] And the first to call is the mother .
[unused1] [unused2] Sa ##ba has n ##' ##t delivered yet .
[unused1] [unused2] Everyone wanted to call .
[unused1] [unused2] So , on small notes , they wrote the phone numbers we did n ##' ##t get to dial , hoping we ' ##d deliver on our promise that we ' ##d call on their behalf .
[unused1] [unused2] Now that the war is winding down , is his support among Democrats looking up ?
[unused1] [unused2] Two Americans who gave their lives to Operation Iraqi Freedom were buried at Arlington National Cemetery today .
[unused1] [unused2] Marine Lance Corporal Patrick Nixon was one of 17 killed in an ambush near Na ##sir ##iya ##h on March 23 .
[unused1] [unused2] He was 21 years old and the first Ten ##ness ##ean to die in the war .
[unused1] [unused2] He died of injuries from a grenade attack by a fellow soldier .
[unused1] [unused2] And this final story : retired Senator St ##rom T ##hur ##mond has never made a secret about his fond ##ness for young , pretty women .
[unused1] [unused2] So some think T ##hur ##mond ' ##s travel plans in South Carolina next month are rather fitting .
[unused1] [unused2] He ' ##ll fly to his first public appearance since returning to his home state aboard the private jet of a Ho ##oters Air executive .
[unused1] [unused2] I know during the war , before the war , you were very concerned about the position of the Syrian government , co ##oper ##ating with Iraqi ##s , having an open border , if you will .
[unused1] [unused2] Has the situation improved , especially in the aftermath now of the secretary of state ' ##s meeting with Ba ##sha ##r al ##- ##As ##ad ?
[unused1] [unused2] I talked to Secretary Powell this morning on the phone a bit , and it ' ##s not , I think you need to let the dust settle on that .
[unused1] [unused2] But right now you ' ##re open ##- ##mind ##ed as far as Syria on whether they will crack down on terrorism , take some of the other steps that you want them to take ?
[unused1] [unused2] The secretary of state has written you a letter expressing , apparently , some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to be spending , those detained at the U ##. ##S ##.
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t think that ' ##s quite accurate as to what he wrote me about .
[unused1] [unused2] I think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter ##- ##age ##ncy process , where we have all these FBI and Department of Justice and CIA and D ##IA , and what have you , involved in inter ##rog ##ating these de ##tain ##ees , it takes time to find out what intelligence they have .
[unused1] [unused2] Do you want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back , to have parade ##s in New York , Washington , elsewhere ?
[unused1] [unused2] In the case of 1991 , the task was to go in and get them out of Kuwait , and they did it , and they were properly greeted coming back to the United States .
[unused1] [unused2] It was to remove that regime , and it ' ##s part of a global war on terrorism that is not over .
[unused1] [unused2] Certainly , our war plan was not modeled off of 1991 .
[unused1] [unused2] ... a pre ##em ##pt ##ive strike , is that something that is out there ?
[unused1] [unused2] I know that back in the 1990s , in the Clinton administration , Secretary Perry called in the former secret ##aries of defense , and we had a discussion , and they clearly had tee ##d up a military option that they were considering , and they then at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that that was not appropriate .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s important in the war against terrorism that we r ##out out whatever is there and , likewise , the people involved , because they might help supply al Qaeda or other terrorists along the trail .
[unused1] [unused2] If he is alive , obviously , he does n ##' ##t pose the kind of threat that an O ##sa ##ma bin La ##den does with his cellular network around the world to react ##ivate al Qaeda and international terrorism .
[unused1] [unused2] It would be , certainly , to know , to app ##re ##hend him , to bring him before a court of justice .
[unused1] [unused2] But I do n ##' ##t think it ' ##s absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we app ##re ##hend him or find out what happened to him .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , I would hope that sooner rather than later we could see a civilian government emerge in Iraq , a democratic ##ally elected one , that there ' ##d be more cooperation from the international community , on both the peace ##keeping side as well as the political restructuring that ' ##s necessary in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] And second ##arily , what about countries like France , Germany , and Russia , which opposed the Bush administration ' ##s war plans , do you want them shut out ?
[unused1] [unused2] They ' ##ll also be taking your phone calls .
[unused1] [unused2] lawyers in te ##xa ##s are trying to keep their client from becoming the 300 ##th person executed in the state since 1982 , when te ##xa ##s resumed capital punishment .
[unused1] [unused2] they ' ##re asking the supreme court to block tonight ' ##s scheduled execution of del ##ma banks .
[unused1] [unused2] he ' ##d be the 11th killer put to death in te ##xa ##s this year .
[unused1] [unused2] in northern i ##ra ##q , u ##. ##s ##. war ##planes hit targets including a ridge east of m ##os ##ul , where i ##ra ##qi troops have been en ##tre ##nched .
[unused1] [unused2] two f ##- ##14 to ##m ##cats struck the targets , the same area was a site of heavy bombing yesterday .
[unused1] [unused2] after today ' ##s air strikes , 13 i ##ra ##qi soldiers abandoned their posts and surrendered to k ##ur ##dis ##h fighters .
[unused1] [unused2] one concern these men have in the water ##ways of i ##ra ##q is the threat of an ambush , so there are five weapon stations on the special operations craft .
[unused1] [unused2] that ' ##s what we ' ##re doing as we come through here and completely search these ##s have else to make sure there ' ##s no one lurking on there with weapons or r ##p ##gs or some other pad to take down he ##los that are flying by or any other ships that are coming in through here .

[unused1] [unused2] a member of the international committee of red cross visited the local hospital there , and he says it ' ##s a horrible scene .
[unused1] [unused2] the associated press is reporting that u ##. ##s ##. troops have launched an attack on sad ##dam international airport .
[unused1] [unused2] witnesses say i ##ra ##qi troops are dug in trying to f ##end off coalition troops making their way into the capital ' ##s main airport .
[unused1] [unused2] a re ##uters correspondent said dozens of i ##ra ##qi civilians and soldiers were killed in what witnesses called a barrage of u ##. ##s ##. artillery .

[unused1] [unused2] pale ##st ##inian sources say he had tried to flee into s ##yr ##ia , but was turned away at the border .

[unused1] [unused2] is the u ##. ##s ##. going to war ?
[unused1] [unused2] if you listen to the from ' ##s men it sounds like the battle is about to begin , maybe only days from now .
[unused1] [unused2] am ##eric ##a ' ##s top diplomat laid out the case for war .
[unused1] [unused2] over at the pen ##tag ##on , the military leaders say that troops are ready to fight right now even as they a ##wai ##t word of the president ' ##s order , but there is major opposition today , f ##rance , g ##erman ##y and r ##uss ##ia plan a show ##down at the ##up ##ups in a bid to stop the u ##. ##s ##. ' ##s war machine and their voices of di ##ssent echoed by protest ##ors from au ##stra ##lia to e ##gy ##pt to university students right here in the united states .
[unused1] [unused2] later this hour i ' ##ll speak exclusively to cardinal p ##io la ##gh ##i , the man di ##sma ##tched by pope j ##oh ##n p ##aul ii to persuade president bush to avoid war , but we begin with reports from the united nations , the pen ##tag ##on and the white house .
[unused1] [unused2] first to ch ##ris burns with news on the president and the secretary of state who switched from diplomacy to talk of war .
[unused1] [unused2] they rejected challenges to the law of sentences of 25 years to life without parole for a man convicted of stealing some golf clubs and 50 years for a man who stole some video ##ta ##pes .
[unused1] [unused2] the idea is if you have three f ##elo ##ny convictions , you ' ##re out of here .
[unused1] [unused2] they appealed to the supreme court on behalf of these two people .
[unused1] [unused2] currently in ca ##li ##fo ##rn ##ia , 700 ##0 people serving 25 to year life sentences under the three strikes law .
[unused1] [unused2] you can e ##- ##mail us at am ##@ ##c ##nn ##. ##com .
[unused1] [unused2] it ' ##s designed to counter the kind of thing that i found in the new yo ##rk newspaper this morning where a br ##ook ##lyn woman who s ##cal ##ded her 4 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old to death in a bath ##tub , walked out of court a free woman yesterday sentenced to five years probation .
[unused1] [unused2] it took the child three weeks to die in the hot from - ##- hospital from the injuries it suffered at the hands of its mother and she ' ##s free .
[unused1] [unused2] five years probation for killing her 4 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old by s ##cal ##ding it to death in the bath ##tub .
[unused1] [unused2] tens of thousands of college and high school students stage anti ##war protests on campuses yesterday from coast ##- ##to ##- ##coa ##st .
[unused1] [unused2] ca ##li ##fo ##rn ##ia now , high school and college students there skipped class to show their opposition to a u ##. ##s ##. ##- ##led war with i ##ra ##q .
[unused1] [unused2] the books not bombs demonstration co ##ored na ##ed by the national youth and student peace coalition .
[unused1] [unused2] another story out of be ##l ##grade , violence at the highest form .
[unused1] [unused2] the se ##rb ##ian prime minister , z ##oran d ##jin ##d ##ji ##c has died of his wounds after being shot , an assassination attempt .
[unused1] [unused2] apparently , he was on his way to greet reporters at the time outside the main government office there in be ##l ##grade .
[unused1] [unused2] the word from se ##rb ##ia , z ##oran d ##jin ##d ##ji ##c , the prime minister , is dead .
[unused1] [unused2] earlier reports said he was shot in the back , as well as the stomach .
[unused1] [unused2] and i just hope and pray that congress will quickly pass the amber alert so that those children will have a better chance because they cross the state line and they ' ##re out of commission .
[unused1] [unused2] and as will ##iam and she saw each other , it was such a wonderful reunion for them to just hug , and they - ##- he would hug her and look at her and hug her and look at her .
[unused1] [unused2] with the darkness that surrounds us in these times of the possibility of war that could be coming upon us and a miracle that has been brought to us , an incredible miracle that has been brought to our family , words can not express how grateful we are for the prayers around the world .
[unused1] [unused2] perhaps with that in mind , the nation ' ##s threat level back at orange , or high , to disco ##urage and th ##wart potential terrorist attacks .
[unused1] [unused2] there will be additional random inspection ##s of vehicles and potentially , depending on the airport , some limitations of in ##de ##g ##ree ##s and e ##g ##ress into the airport .
[unused1] [unused2] it gives you a sense of , perhaps what 50 years of tension and war will do to your mental ##ity .
[unused1] [unused2] president bush , when he talked earlier to reporters , mentioned that this effort is an effort , this war is an effort to make the homeland , our homeland , more secure .
[unused1] [unused2] as we have the strikes overseas throughout i ##ra ##q , there will be re ##tal ##iator ##y terror strikes , either by organized terrorist networks or sympathetic terrorists or people against the united states in this country .
[unused1] [unused2] the national security advisor fan ##ning out , we ' ##re told in phone calls to more than three dozen world leaders offering them an update on what is going on .
[unused1] [unused2] we see bag ##h ##dad , a cap ##ito ##l under siege .
[unused1] [unused2] we heard from secretary r ##ums ##feld who brief ##ed us on the early stages of the war .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : so even at the very early stages of a defining moment of bush presidency , the president trying to make the case his eyes and especially the eyes of his cabinet still on the domestic affairs of the united states as the early prosecution of the war continues .
[unused1] [unused2] that is handful more nations that were actively involved in the coalition his father assembled 12 years ago for the per ##sian g ##ulf war , but there is a significant difference , of course .
[unused1] [unused2] in this coalition , it i ##ps the united states doing the overwhelming load of the fighting .
[unused1] [unused2] in the last g ##ulf war , you had a ##rab forces on the ground .
[unused1] [unused2] while we do , we want to tell you marine ##s battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of na ##sir ##iya ##h face stiff resistance from i ##ra ##qi paramilitary groups today .
[unused1] [unused2] for some perspective , let ' ##s turn to miles o ##' ##bri ##en with retired air force general don she ##pper ##d .
[unused1] [unused2] if you are going to fight on the ground , you have to encounter bridges somewhere along the way .
[unused1] [unused2] this is one technique , one possible way u ##. ##s ##. forces might seize a bridge , a bridge that might be defended by i ##ra ##qi ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] this would be representing m ##1 ##- ##a ##1 tanks coming towards the bridge firing .
[unused1] [unused2] makes it vulnerable to fire from the other side .
[unused1] [unused2] artillery behind them firing back .
[unused1] [unused2] the idea of the smoke screen is to obscure the on ##coming forces fire ing at you from being able to see .
[unused1] [unused2] again , today , there were disturbing hints , and we under ##sco ##re hints here , that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : the evidence is a ##cc ##um ##ulating that i ##ra ##q may be planning to use chemical weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : the findings are height ##ening concerns among coalition forces approaching bag ##h ##dad since , as the i ##ra ##qi ##s should know , u ##. ##s ##. and br ##itis ##h forces do not use chemical weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] u ##. ##s ##. officials say some intelligence indicates a red line may have been drawn around the capital with republican guard units ordered to use chemical weapons once u ##. ##s ##. and allied troops cross it .
[unused1] [unused2] there has been intelligence scrap ##s , who knows how accurate they are , chat ##ter in the system , that suggests that the closer that coalition forces get to bag ##h ##dad and t ##ik ##rit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put in place .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : experts say sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein ' ##s forces will likely try to hold out in bag ##h ##dad for as long as possible without using the weapons his government insists it does not have , hoping to build international pressure on the u ##. ##s ##. and br ##ita ##in to back down .
[unused1] [unused2] in that sense any use of chemical weapons would be counter ##p ##rod ##uctive to sad ##dam , because it would only gal ##vani ##ze international
[unused1] [unused2] for some am ##eric ##ans who find themselves spending hours on end watching television coverage of the war , it can be hard to break away .
[unused1] [unused2] that is especially true if you have a loved one in the war zone .
[unused1] [unused2] more than 70 percent of am ##eric ##ans say they are sad about the war .
[unused1] [unused2] if there ' ##s any kind of terrorism that happens here , i think that would definitely put a damp ##er on everything .
[unused1] [unused2] air travel has fallen 10 me ##rs since the war began and some hotel chains say cancellation ##s are up .
[unused1] [unused2] 60 percent of the people say they ' ##re watching the war .
[unused1] [unused2] maybe fewer are flying because they worry about terrorism or they worry about what the war will do to the economy or maybe it ' ##s everything .
[unused1] [unused2] they say some i ##ra ##qi ##s who worked in the field before the war already are asking for their jobs back .
[unused1] [unused2] and these pictures show i ##ra ##qi ##s running for cover just before u ##. ##s ##. planes dropped a bomb near northern i ##ra ##q .
[unused1] [unused2] just as they disappear over the ridge , you can hear the planes and the explosions and then you see the cloud .
[unused1] [unused2] ask any am ##eric ##an marine and they ' ##ll tell you they ' ##ll do anything possible to recover the bodies of fallen comrades .
[unused1] [unused2] that grim task was carried out by marine ##s engaged in the fierce battle for the city of na ##sir ##iya ##h na ##sir ##iya ##h .
[unused1] [unused2] us ##air ##ways is flying its way out of bankruptcy .
[unused1] [unused2] coming up right here , next hour on live from , terror tactics on the battlefield .
[unused1] [unused2] we ' ##ll talk with a terror expert about that , and i ##ra ##qi desert ##ers on the northern front .
[unused1] [unused2] ben wed ##eman has their story why they ' ##re no longer fighting for sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein and don she ##pper ##d is going to answer some of your questions as he looks at the battle hot spots .
[unused1] [unused2] now let ' ##s go back to wolf b ##litz ##er in k ##u ##wai ##t city for more special coverage of the war in i ##ra ##q .
[unused1] [unused2] we ' ##re getting late word tonight that g ##eral ##do river ##a may not be be kicked out of i ##ra ##q after all .
[unused1] [unused2] originally the central command said the veteran fox news correspond was being expelled because he compromised the location of the unit he ' ##s been embedded with .
[unused1] [unused2] says he ' ##s not aware he ' ##s being expelled but says if so , it is because some bitter former colleagues of his at m ##s ##n ##b ##c blew the whistle on him .
[unused1] [unused2] it sounds to me like some rats at my former network , n ##b ##c , are spreading some lies about me .
[unused1] [unused2] the central command on the other hand says river ##a is being kicked out of i ##ra ##q because ` ##` he gave away the big picture stuff . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] all of this now under review , whether or not g ##eral ##do stays or goes .
[unused1] [unused2] we ' ##ll continue to monitor that front on the store y ##ix another veteran war correspondent is being fired for his controversial conduct in i ##ra ##q .
[unused1] [unused2] n ##b ##c is terminating freelance ##r reporter pet ##er a ##rne ##tt for statements he made to the i ##ra ##qi media .
[unused1] [unused2] he said the coalition ' ##s first war plan had failed because of i ##ra ##qi resistance .
[unused1] [unused2] now , i said in that interview essentially what we all know about the war , there have been delays in implementing policy , there has been surprises .
[unused1] [unused2] a ##rne ##tt had been covering the war for national geographic , which also fired him as t ##v reports were given exclusively to n ##b ##c and m ##s ##n ##b ##c .
[unused1] [unused2] late word from lo ##ndon that the ta ##bloid the daily mirror just hired pet ##er a ##rne ##tt to be its correspondent in bag ##h ##dad .
[unused1] [unused2] meanwhile , as war is fought a world away , federal , state and local authorities face their own battle keeping am ##eric ##ans safe at home .
[unused1] [unused2] the dying regime if i ##ra ##q may try to bring terror to our shore shores .
[unused1] [unused2] other parts of the global terror network may view this as a moment to strike , thinking that we ' ##re distracted .
[unused1] [unused2] we ' ##re not just going to say we ' ##re lucky we did n ##' ##t get attacked today .
[unused1] [unused2] an airport in key west , fl ##ori ##da , today became the setting of what appeared to be a desperate attempt to enter the u ##. ##s ##. by a cu ##ban national .
[unused1] [unused2] the man was arrested there after authorities say he hi ##jack ##ed a cu ##ban plane using what was reported to be grenades , ordering the pilots to fly to fl ##ori ##da .
[unused1] [unused2] j ##ess ##ica l ##ync ##h arrived at the ram ##stein air base in g ##erman ##y for medical treatment .
[unused1] [unused2] a little later we ' ##ll speak with her family and talk a closer look at the daring operation that produced her safe recovery , but first the push into bag ##h ##dad .
[unused1] [unused2] they say their forces today with the i ##ra ##qi republican guard units as part of a pro ##t ##wo ##- ##p ##rong ##ed advance on the city .
[unused1] [unused2] however , the pen ##tag ##on is down playing the idea that an invasion of bag ##h ##dad is imminent .
[unused1] [unused2] u ##. ##s ##. officials say they are n ##' ##t sure whether the i ##ra ##qi president is still alive .
[unused1] [unused2] regardless , the statement praised i ##ra ##qi ##s who have fought coalition forces .
[unused1] [unused2] it was said to be sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein ' ##s response to a letter from his niece .
[unused1] [unused2] j ##ess ##ica l ##ync ##h says she can not wait to get home to west virgin ##ia .
[unused1] [unused2] the 19 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old army private spoke to her parents yesterday pie phone from a hospital in g ##erman ##y .
[unused1] [unused2] g ##re ##g l ##ync ##h says that when he talked to his daughter she had n ##' ##t eaten in eight days and was quite hungry .
[unused1] [unused2] the washing ##ton post is reporting she shot several i ##ra ##qi soldiers before she was captured and she was shot herself , too .
[unused1] [unused2] coming up on our next hour , u ##. ##s ##. forces edged toward the outskirts of bag ##h ##dad and we ' ##ll tell you what kind of resistance they ' ##re fat ##ing from sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein ' ##s elite republican guard .
[unused1] [unused2] that is the very joy ##ous town of pale ##st ##ine , west virgin ##ia , on the news that j ##ess ##ica l ##ync ##h is eventually going to come home .

[unused1] [unused2] bombardment of bag ##h ##dad continues tonight and over the past 20 minutes , explosions rocking bag ##h ##dad , central bag ##h ##dad southern bag ##h ##dad , the outskirts of bag ##h ##dad , and importantly , as the coalition forces , principally u ##. ##s ##. army forces , move against sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein international airport - ##- which is about ten miles outside the center of bag ##h ##dad - ##- those explosions are in ##tens ##ifies .
[unused1] [unused2] that it is very difficult to disc ##ern whether or not that is , in point of fact , the missiles that we have become accustomed to striking bag ##h ##dad and its en ##vir ##ons , or whether it is the large 2 ##, ##00 ##0 pound j ##dam bombs that have been striking targets s ##cle ##cted by the coalition in bag ##h ##dad , or whether these flashes now represent artillery barrage ##s as fighting continues to take control of the - ##- to take control of sad ##dam international airport .
[unused1] [unused2] and we are told that , of those , 850 were strike sort ##ies , motor vehicle most of those directed against the republican guard .
[unused1] [unused2] two of those divisions absolutely devastated , destroyed .
[unused1] [unused2] four other divisions we are told have also been hit very , very very hard and are principally trying to reinforce units v ##a also been hit very hard .
[unused1] [unused2] and that raises questions , questions that have been in front of us since that first strike on march 19th against the location that the c ##ia military intelligence thought was a place where sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein , perhaps his sons , were .
[unused1] [unused2] that pre ##em ##pt ##ive strike they put , i think somewhat elegant ##ly , trying to strike at the head of the snake .
[unused1] [unused2] new explosions rocking parts of bag ##h ##dad tonight .
[unused1] [unused2] we , of course , will bring the word to you just as soon as the army and coalition forces do take control of sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein international airport , just on the outskirts of bag ##h ##dad .

[unused1] [unused2] bag ##h ##dad has had s ##poradic episodes of this tonight .
[unused1] [unused2] no major explosions we ' ##re aware of , but just , apparently , in the last few moments , there has been activity .

[unused1] [unused2] as we watched this picture of the air force one getting into this airport i want to bring in our military analyst general da ##n c ##rism ##an to go over what happens happening in bag ##h ##dad .
[unused1] [unused2] what they ' ##re doing is going in now , very carefully , obviously some symbolic raids against palace ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] they ' ##re going to be defended fan ##atic ##ally but intelligence is so crucial from aerial platforms and special op ##s personnel to give the three assets the in ##tel which they need to close with and eliminate final remnants of the regime in those city ##s .

[unused1] [unused2] brigadier general v ##in ##ce br ##ook ##s confirmed a us ##a ##- ##10 war ##th ##og aircraft was shot down by an i ##ra ##qi missile today .
[unused1] [unused2] military officials say a missile hit his war ##th ##og and he was forced to e ##ject .
[unused1] [unused2] he was going on a mission south of bag ##h ##dad when he was close to his target area , all of a sudden he heard a noise .
[unused1] [unused2] turns out it was an i ##ra ##qi missile , a very likely a shoulder fired missile that hit his aircraft .
[unused1] [unused2] ejected landed in the desert south of bag ##h ##dad and then he was rescued by u ##. ##s ##. army ground troops who were in the area .

[unused1] [unused2] 56 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old for ##ry d ##rak ##e has been charged with interstate transport of a minor .
[unused1] [unused2] i ' ##m le ##ban ##ese born .
[unused1] [unused2] i grew up in war zones .
[unused1] [unused2] i was the only one during this conflict who had pictures of republican guards and it ' ##s true luck because i was driving northwest of bag ##h ##dad and i bumped into these guys going around the capital .
[unused1] [unused2] i did n ##' ##t feel any i did n ##' ##t realize what the fire power was .
[unused1] [unused2] had to stop an attack south of bag ##h ##dad .
[unused1] [unused2] those pilots were captured on march 24th , after their a ##pa ##che helicopter went down in i ##ra ##qi territory .
[unused1] [unused2] during a brief phone call with their son from k ##u ##wai ##t on sur ##ng ##d the arm asked the young family not to get into any specific details about what happened during their son ' ##s capture and release .
[unused1] [unused2] now they are learning more details that their son in fact was kicked and beaten after his capture , and that his fellow pilot da ##vid will ##iam ##s had a knife held to his throat immediately after an t ##ur , according to an interview their son was allowed to conduct with ` ##` the washing ##ton post ' ##' , who flew with him into k ##u ##wai ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] i came home , she was in bed , i laid on the couch for a couple of hours , walked around , i thought , i ' ##m going to sleep tonight , i really am .
[unused1] [unused2] young ' ##s mother says , when she sees her son , she plans on hugging him for a good solid half hour .
[unused1] [unused2] i was on the phone with mi ##chel ##le will ##iam ##s yesterday , when she saw those first pictures on c ##nn of her husband , and she sleek ##ed with delight .
[unused1] [unused2] the two met , mi ##chel ##le and da ##vid in flight school .
[unused1] [unused2] this was the it ##alia ##n ship that was taken - ##- that was captured by pale ##st ##inian terrorists back in 1985 and some may remember the story of le ##on c ##ling ##hov ##er , he was in a ch ##eal chair and the terrorists shot him and pushed him over the side of the ship into the me ##dit ##er ##rane ##an where he obviously , died .
[unused1] [unused2] he ' ##s been in l ##ib ##ya and he ' ##s been living under the protection of sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein in bag ##h ##dad , but he is wanted for murder in it ##aly it ##aly .
[unused1] [unused2] there are charges , u ##. ##s ##. charges which have expired but could , i am told , possibly be re - ##- restart ##ed for p ##iracy , hostage taking and conspiracy .
[unused1] [unused2] so this is one of the oldest cases of terrorism that is one of the oldest cases that has not been closed to date t ##. now look as if this man a ##bu a ##bs ##aa ##s in u ##. ##s ##. hands .
[unused1] [unused2] the co ##roner examining the remains of two bodies recovered near sa ##n f ##ran ##cis ##co bay yesterday was unable to determine the cause of death .
[unused1] [unused2] police are now considering the possibility that the remains are those of la ##ci pet ##erson and her un ##born child .
[unused1] [unused2] and they say these experts will be able to tell how long the body had been in there and if the remains of the almost full ##- ##ter ##m baby boy were inside the female ' ##s remains at the time of death .
[unused1] [unused2] also , the co ##roner could know right now but is not saying if there was some sort of trauma to either of these skeleton ##s , for example , if they could see the bone compromised in some way they could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting .
[unused1] [unused2] all one of the many young faces that bear the heavy mark of war .
[unused1] [unused2] if the workers do n ##' ##t approve the steep cut backs am ##eric ##an says it will file for bankruptcy .
[unused1] [unused2] he was shot and thrown over ##board .
[unused1] [unused2] u ##. ##s ##. forces in bag ##h ##dad are staging spot raids around that city , searching for hold ##out members of sad ##dam ' ##s regime .
[unused1] [unused2] and as part of that effort , u ##. ##s ##. special forces today raided the home of the i ##ra ##qi micro ##bio ##logist known as d ##r ##. g ##er ##m .
[unused1] [unused2] for killing his wife and three children the oldest of whom was three , ch ##rist ##ian long ##o had been sentenced to die .
[unused1] [unused2] the jury deliberate ##d for three hour before returning a death sentence .
[unused1] [unused2] by u ##. ##s ##. forces and which appears to be run by members of the the war began in i ##ra ##q several weeks ago .
[unused1] [unused2] the unrest continues there and this follows up the shooting we talked about yesterday in which at least seven i ##ra ##qi ##s were killed by u ##. ##s ##. fire after they apparently came under fire trying to secure a certain part of the central part of m ##os ##ul .
[unused1] [unused2] you might remember last week when another half ##- ##bro ##ther of sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein was picked up trying to cross into s ##yr ##ia and that time , we have been told s ##yr ##ia has closed its border with i ##ra ##q to prevent any of that ongoing .
[unused1] [unused2] one is the capture of number 24 as it ' ##s described , sa ##mir who is responsible for the bag ##h ##dad district , indication ##s are the k ##ur ##ds in the north handed this man over so this is number 4 out of that playing card deck of 55 that the u ##. ##s ##. is after .
[unused1] [unused2] also that bomb site in bag ##h ##dad hit about a week and a half ago , the man ##so ##ur district .
[unused1] [unused2] there is strong speculation that sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein may be his two sons were inside of that building when it was hit by coalition bombs , or may have left prior to the bombing taking place .
[unused1] [unused2] in a moment , check in the pen ##tag ##on and get the latest on the i ##ra ##qi prisoners of war .
[unused1] [unused2] we know of one detention center , well over 7 ##, ##00 ##0 i ##ra ##qi ##s held there and almost a thousand have been released .
[unused1] [unused2] 6 ##: ##0 ##3 a ##. ##m ##. eastern time , seven am ##eric ##ans who had been prisoners of war in i ##ra ##q make a public appearance at the medical center in g ##erman ##y .
[unused1] [unused2] they say they ' ##re looking forward to going home , which relatives of one former p ##. ##o ##. ##w ##.
[unused1] [unused2] officials at the hospital say the se ##v reason in good shape and their pro ##gno ##sis is excellent , even though three have gunshot wounds .
[unused1] [unused2] 6 ##: ##21 eastern time , 2 ##: ##21 p ##. ##m ##. in i ##ra ##q , i ##ra ##qi protesters demonstrate outside a bag ##h ##dad mosque , opposing what they call the u ##. ##s ##. occupation , and saying any new i ##ra ##qi government must represent the people .
[unused1] [unused2] but it ' ##s not clear whether the people buried there are victims of regime atrocities , or whether it ' ##s simply a military graveyard .
[unused1] [unused2] 7 ##: ##0 ##5 a ##. ##m ##. , u ##. ##s ##. central command says another top b ##aa ##th party official has been captured .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : as the extent of the looked ##ding and destruction came to light , experts in the u ##. ##k ##. were making plans to help .
[unused1] [unused2] a man who had assault , he actually had assault with a deadly weapon , this is pictures .
[unused1] [unused2] the man came out and did the spread eagle like that , just as he did that , that ' ##s when you saw the child just walking just a few feet away from him but the officers were able to get the child away .
[unused1] [unused2] they hand ##cu ##ffed the man and they took him into custody .
[unused1] [unused2] knew sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein ' ##s re ##j g ##ee ##m ##g is no more , the focus in i ##ra ##q is turning from military action to rebuilding which means the coalition ' ##s role in the country will have to change .
[unused1] [unused2] military analyst and retired army general c ##lau ##dia k ##enne ##dy joins me with a look at possibility ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] for the latest on the company to avoid bankruptcy , check with r ##hon ##da s ##cha ##ffle ##r .
[unused1] [unused2] and if it ' ##s rejected the largest airline may have to file for bankruptcy .
[unused1] [unused2] what ' ##s go on is that union members became outrage ##d after learning about the airline ' ##s executive compensation plan where w ##oi would have paid huge bonus ##es even in bankruptcy .

[unused1] [unused2] on a ##p ##ril 9th , about 130 journalists from around the world including myself and a couple of reporters , we were going to try to cross the border because we were all desperate to get into i ##ra ##q , two days after the sad ##dam statue fell and we all knew it was over .
[unused1] [unused2] 156 i ##ra ##qi police officers were supposed to show up to this college to report for work .
[unused1] [unused2] but instead , 2 ##, ##00 ##0 showed up because they heard about it on the radio .
[unused1] [unused2] we came across a check ##point and there were about maybe five , six i ##ra ##qi locals with a ##k ##- ##47 machine guns and checking cars .
[unused1] [unused2] those kind of neat that the i ##ra ##qi ##s are taking pride in the fall of the regime and wanting to restore order themselves .
[unused1] [unused2] so we went into this bunker hoping to find a prison and run into these prisoners and instead we ran into a room full ##s of weapons from bullets to hand grenade , land mines , rocket ##- ##p ##rop ##elle ##d grenades .

[unused1] [unused2] that was then , this is now , 20 years after meeting sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein in bag ##h ##dad , defense secretary don ##ald r ##ums ##feld is back in the i ##ra ##qi capital with victorious u ##. ##s ##. troops .

[unused1] [unused2] after the president came aboard , he then spent a considerable amount of time talking to many of the young men and women on the flight deck , taking photographs with them , still wearing his flight suit throughout much of that period , talking to them and again this evening , he will be issuing a major address to the am ##eric ##an people re ##guard ##ing the end of major combat operation .

[unused1] [unused2] typical perfect day in sa ##n die ##go waiting for these men and women to come home .
[unused1] [unused2] i just think about all the family members sitting at home , sitting on the dock looking at this boat coming in .
[unused1] [unused2] some of these had children while they were out at sea and this is the first time that - ##- first opportunity to get home and meet and hold them .
[unused1] [unused2] just about to come home .
[unused1] [unused2] although this came home by itself from ha ##wai ##i .
[unused1] [unused2] it is a battle group that goes out .
[unused1] [unused2] it ' ##s going to have to make a trip up the coast .
[unused1] [unused2] just getting back from spending a tour in k ##u ##wai ##t during the war .
[unused1] [unused2] the country reported now 160 new cases and nine more deaths .
[unused1] [unused2] 20 people were killed in that state .
[unused1] [unused2] in ka ##ns ##as , authorities say seven people were killed when tornadoes cut across the southeastern part of the state .
[unused1] [unused2] an emergency official tells c ##nn that ten people died there .
[unused1] [unused2] dozens were hurt .
[unused1] [unused2] joining us on the phone is the mayor of jack ##son , ten ##ness ##ee , ch ##ar ##les farmer .
[unused1] [unused2] he believed in the merger like most other people did .
[unused1] [unused2] interesting point here also , people are suggesting he may be raising this money to buy those at ##lant ##a sports teams that apparently are on the block .
[unused1] [unused2] it ' ##s happened , of course , several times during the war in i ##ra ##q , journalists caught in the line of fire and killed .
[unused1] [unused2] is ##rae ##li troops are facing a similar situation with two journalists killed in just the past two weeks .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : f ##rida ##y night in the g ##az ##a strip and a journalist is about to lose his life .
[unused1] [unused2] shortly after several shots are heard an is ##rae ##li bull ##do ##zer can be seen un ##cover ##ing the is ##rae ##lis say , a tunnel used to smug ##gle weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] after the journalists shout , another gunshot .
[unused1] [unused2] moments later , another shot and the sound of someone in pain .
[unused1] [unused2] 34 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old br ##itis ##h journalist jam ##es mill ##er died on the scene after is ##rae ##li soldiers come to his aid , the is ##rae ##li defense sources says .
[unused1] [unused2] jam ##es was not shooting and he was not with somebody shooting .
[unused1] [unused2] the is ##rae ##li government said its forces were returning fire and that mill ##er was shot in the back , suggesting he could have been hit by pale ##st ##inian gun ##men .
[unused1] [unused2] those close to mill ##er believe he was shot by an armored is ##rae ##li personnel carrier .
[unused1] [unused2] we know the is ##rae ##lis fired .
[unused1] [unused2] whether or not he was shot by is ##rae ##lis gunfire , we are not certain at this time .
[unused1] [unused2] mill ##er becomes the second journalist in just two weeks to be killed covering the is ##rae ##li ##- ##pal ##est ##inian conflict .
[unused1] [unused2] with pale ##st ##inian camera ##men , shot and killed by an is ##rae ##li soldier on the west bank in mid ##- ##ap ##ril .
[unused1] [unused2] with back ##- ##to ##- ##back deaths making a total of at least seven journalists killed covering the conflict in the past two and a half years .
[unused1] [unused2] the message from the is ##rae ##li government is that its soldiers are not targeting journalists , but that journalists who travel to places where there could be live fire exchange between is ##rae ##li forces and pale ##st ##inian gun ##men have a responsibility to take greater pre ##ca ##ution ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] it ' ##s a life and death situation .
[unused1] [unused2] he was called comic al ##bu ##quer ##que i or bag ##h ##dad b ##ob during the war in i ##ra ##q when he kept ##ic si ##fting things were going badly for the u ##. ##s ##. and great for sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : i ##ra ##q ' ##s former information minister might need a job right now .

[unused1] [unused2] are they trying to swim to shore we ` ll
[unused1] [unused2] what ' ##s believed to be the terror cell responsible for 9 ##/ ##11 .
[unused1] [unused2] major fighting may be over , but many am ##eric ##an service men and women injured in i ##ra ##q are just beginning the very long process of recovery .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : the story of how he got to washing ##ton , d ##. ##c ##. , is compelling for several reasons , starting with how close he came to not being here at all .
[unused1] [unused2] i was definitely blessed that i ' ##m not paralyzed or dead .
[unused1] [unused2] 24 hours before the fall of bag ##h ##dad , 24 hours before his fellow marine ##s engaged in a fierce fire ##fight at bag ##h ##dad university , tee ##ter ##man ' ##s orders had him just south of the capital taking out i ##ra ##qi resistance a top a warehouse roof .
[unused1] [unused2] there were small pockets of resistance in the area , two , three man groups who had a ##k ##- ##47 ##s and possible r ##p ##gs and what not and our job was to just observe forward and make sure no one was waiting to ambush the a ##v ##s or the tanks and i was on a metal roof and i stepped
[unused1] [unused2] i want to thank the president for spa ##in ' ##s diplomatic support before the conflict .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LS ##B ##- translator speaking - ##RS ##B ##- and for the use of span ##ish air space and bases as the war grew closer .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LS ##B ##- translator speaking - ##RS ##B ##- i also offer my con ##do ##len ##ces to the family and friends of the two members of the span ##ish media who lost their lives while covering the hostilities .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LS ##B ##- trance lay or the speaking - ##RS ##B ##- across the globe , spa ##in and am ##eric ##a will continue as strong ally ##s in the war against terror .
[unused1] [unused2] your journey , particularly to southern i ##ra ##q , what is e ##voked there a sense of both that you e ##voke is a sense of history of this regime .
[unused1] [unused2] i was n ##' ##t in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside bag ##dad airport but i had long thought and i was in i ##ra ##q in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially non ##sen ##si ##cal because in 1990 , sad ##dam h ##uss ##ein made the only self criticism .
[unused1] [unused2] he said , i could either invade k ##u ##wai ##t or finish developing the nuclear weapon .
[unused1] [unused2] maybe before the weapon and then later he said , oh , i should have got the nuclear weapon before i invaded .
[unused1] [unused2] but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen ##- ##ye ##ar ' ##s war where the united states could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we ' ##re arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in ' ##9 ##1 when it could have been finished .
[unused1] [unused2] taken the risk of supporting a s ##hi ##ite ins ##ur ##re ##ction at that point .
[unused1] [unused2] the little town i was in this southern i ##ra ##q , as far as i got , i ca n ##' ##t b ##oast of further , is where the talks took place .
[unused1] [unused2] we have the trans ##cript of the meeting .
[unused1] [unused2] they use the guns ##hips to kill , we think , not less than 50 ##, ##00 ##0 inhabitants of southern i ##ra ##q and trying to do that to the k ##ur ##ds , as well , so it was a knife edge .
[unused1] [unused2] when they made the decision not to move toward bag ##dad with bad information .
[unused1] [unused2] who have been ho ##rri ##bly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and over ##f ##lights .
[unused1] [unused2] the slogan makes for a powerful bumper stick ##er - ##- guns do n ##' ##t kill people , people do !
[unused1] [unused2] a better one might be , people do and people die and still other people search their souls and struggle for red ##emption .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : it was the lead story across connect ##ic ##ut in early a ##p ##ril , police say j ##en ##nife ##r o ##' ##con ##ner , a connect ##ic ##ut woman with a history of psychiatric problems confessed to shooting her daughter 7 , while the 7 - year ##- ##old girl lay sleeping .
[unused1] [unused2] th ##oma ##s , owner a local gun and motorcycle shop , said he felt gut ##ted when he saw the news reports of o ##' ##con ##ner ' ##s vest on murder charges .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : had sold o ##con ##er the rifle a few months before .
[unused1] [unused2] a former f ##bi inform ##ant accused of being a double agent has been indicted .
[unused1] [unused2] the charges against ka ##tri ##na le ##ung are the latest in an alleged case of sex , spies , and international in ##tri ##gue .
[unused1] [unused2] like any good spy movie , it ' ##s already had a sequel with the first indictment earlier in the week and another one just yesterday .
[unused1] [unused2] just one day after a former f ##bi counter ##int ##elli ##gence agent was indicted on charges of gross ne ##gli ##gence , his mistress of two decades , ka ##tri ##na le ##ung , was herself indicted on more serious charges of copy ##ing and possessing documents relating to the national security of the united states .
[unused1] [unused2] le ##ung ' ##s lawyers wasted little time responding to the grand jury indictment .
[unused1] [unused2] she was recruited actively by the f ##bi because of what she could do and because of what she knew .
[unused1] [unused2] le ##ung was hired by the f ##bi and paid almost $ 2 million over 20 years to spy on the chin ##ese .
[unused1] [unused2] the wizard ##s may not want j ##ord ##an , but the head of the expansion team says j ##ord ##an could run operations there , if he wants to .
[unused1] [unused2] on wed ##nes ##day , washing ##ton wizard ##s ' owner ended the three ##- ##ye ##ar association with j ##ord ##an .
[unused1] [unused2] according to ` ##` the washing ##ton post , ' ##' the meeting de ##generate ##d into name ##- ##cal ##ling after j ##ord ##an was offered $ 10 million in gratitude over the next five years .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : for the first time since being cut from the team in high school , mi ##cha ##el j ##ord ##an was left in the awkward position of being unwanted by the game he has come to define .
[unused1] [unused2] instead , during a meeting that lasted only minutes , team owner told j ##ord ##an his services were no longer necessary .
[unused1] [unused2] she ' ##s accused of beating two of her three children to death because , she says , god told her to .
[unused1] [unused2] this is a rather remarkable arrangement because they are cheer ##ing there the arrival of k ##hat ##ami , the president of i ##ran .
[unused1] [unused2] now , he is making a trip and you see him there with his hands raised , there with the cloak on , shaking his fists , hands class ##ped there , in a salute to the crowd .
[unused1] [unused2] he ##z ##bol ##lah is an organization based in le ##ban ##on that has been ##ify d ##n d ##n been tied to terrorist activity and pet ##er be ##rgen mentioned sa ##udi he ##z ##bol ##lah an organization working in that country .
[unused1] [unused2] we are seeing that secretary of state co ##lin p ##ow ##ell also traveling through the region , trying to get regional leaders there to put more pressure on the pale ##st ##inian ##s to stop any terrorist activities that may be happening on their behalf as well in that region .
[unused1] [unused2] we ' ##ll watch and listening very closely to president k ##hat ##ami ' ##s visit there in be ##ir ##ut , le ##ban ##on .
[unused1] [unused2] twice before becoming president he was so sick , a priest was brought in to give him last rites .
[unused1] [unused2] but da ##lli ##c shows he you ##ed his family ' ##s influence to get into the navy just as am ##eric ##a was on the verge of world war ii .
[unused1] [unused2] k ##enne ##dy entered the navy earning hero status for saving his ship mates when his boat p ##t ##- ##10 ##9 was sunk by the j ##apa ##nese .
[unused1] [unused2] da ##lle ##k says k ##enne ##dy ' ##s brushes with death , combined with his t deaths of his sister and brother , fueled the ambition to led him to become the youngest person elected president in am ##eric ##an history .
[unused1] [unused2] as we told you at the top of this newscast , an ok ##lah ##oma judge has ruled that te ##rry ni ##cho ##ls will indeed stand trial in that state court on 160 counts of first ##- ##de ##g ##ree murder .
[unused1] [unused2] the ok ##lah ##oma city bombing con ##sp ##ira ##tor is already serving a life term in federal prison .
[unused1] [unused2] state proceedings could bring the death penalty if ni ##cho ##ls is convicted .
[unused1] [unused2] a trial date was not immediately set by the judge whose decision came as prose ##cute ##s were still presenting evidence .
[unused1] [unused2] a te ##xa ##s woman is in jail this morning accused of killing her two sons and severely beating another the day before mother ' ##s day .
[unused1] [unused2] yesterday a silent de ##e an ##a lane ##y waited as the judge read the charges against her .
[unused1] [unused2] a bomb exploded today in a courtroom in southern ye ##men , injuring four people , one of them a judge .
[unused1] [unused2] a man with a pistol was arrested outside of the courthouse and police say he admits planning the bombs .
[unused1] [unused2] it was the same courtroom where a suspected al q ##ae ##da militant got a death sentence last week for killing three am ##eric ##an missionaries .
[unused1] [unused2] pet ##erson was arrested for the murder of his wife and un ##born son after their bodies washed ashore in ca ##li ##fo ##rn ##ia .
[unused1] [unused2] he is awaiting trial .
[unused1] [unused2] right now she lives on the upper east side , works at a pre ##sby ##ter ##ian church , has two married daughters and after the news is out , after carrying it for 41 years , she feels better about it .
[unused1] [unused2] i was born four years too late to have slept with j ##f ##k ?
[unused1] [unused2] they came from the rich ##mond ma ##rina as well as the u ##rb ##uin ##ano island , the coast guard station .
[unused1] [unused2] as you know about a month ago la ##ci pet ##erson ' ##s body washed up right here .
[unused1] [unused2] they believe - ##- police say that is where s ##cott pet ##erson told them that he did go fishing the day that la ##ci pet ##erson did disappear .

[unused1] [unused2] mayor mi ##cha ##el b ##loom ##berg will perform the ceremony .
[unused1] [unused2] has somebody from your magazine spent time with him ?
[unused1] [unused2] he spent time with this guy and there was stock ##holm syndrome , he ended up liking the guy .
[unused1] [unused2] as we said , earlier this week , ch ##rist ##ine to ##dd w ##hit ##man stepped do ##up and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why she stepped down , the job she ' ##s done when she was in office and the job that has yet to be complete .
[unused1] [unused2] but now there ' ##s been an awful lot of mon ##day night quarterback quarterback ##ing taking place now that she ' ##s te ##ped down .
[unused1] [unused2] the mystery is that she took the job in the first place or did n ##' ##t leave earlier .
[unused1] [unused2] that ' ##s interesting because leading into it , while she was new jersey governor , she sued the e ##pa and she was very much considering herself to be an environmental ##ist , and then only to end up becoming the head of the e ##pa and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations .
[unused1] [unused2] let ' ##s hear what she had to say last wed ##nes ##day here on c ##nn just after announcing her resignation .
[unused1] [unused2] i ' ##m not leaving because of clashes with the administration , in fact , i have n ##' ##t had any .
[unused1] [unused2] i ' ##m leaving now because it ' ##s the appropriate time to do it .
[unused1] [unused2] i ' ##m sure that it was difficult for her personally , but i think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stress ##ful if everyday she did n ##' ##t see herself being under ##mined and over ##ru ##led ##ded .
[unused1] [unused2] for the next 12 hours into the morning , planes from the carrier will fly missions over a ##f ##ghan ##istan .

[unused1] [unused2] reporter : the fighter jets dropped their or ##dn ##ance in a coordinated at ##ack on a convoy near the a ##f ##ghan city of ch ##oft .
[unused1] [unused2] there was an attack on a convoy of leadership that was identified through various intelligence means .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : but the strikes prove controversial .
[unused1] [unused2] the consequence of injuring or hurting someone who is friendly or non ##par ##tic ##ip ##ant in combat is very difficult to deal with .
[unused1] [unused2] we have dropped or ##dn ##ance today .
[unused1] [unused2] and i ' ##m sure we ' ##ll continue to drop or ##dn ##ance .

[unused1] [unused2] a convicted murderer is released from prison before serving his full sentence and then a nightmare becomes reality .

[unused1] [unused2] he served less than nine years .
[unused1] [unused2] ma ##ryl ##and is the only state that allows un ##che ##cked judicial re ##con ##side ##ration , allowing judges to reduce prison terms at any time after sent ##encing .
[unused1] [unused2] those favor ##ing the rule say it gives convict ##s incentive to behave in prison and enables judges to release prisoners if new evidence comes to light .
[unused1] [unused2] at some point after his release , mi ##cha ##el serious befriended a woman named da ##rlene will ##iam ##son .

[unused1] [unused2] we are expecting some 15 ##, ##00 ##0 people to greet the ` ##` us ##s constellation ' ##' as it comes home .
[unused1] [unused2] they were headed home .
[unused1] [unused2] you were telling me this little beautiful boy was born two days after deployment .

[unused1] [unused2] we were praying that he would get here on time , unfortunately he missed it , but through e ##- ##mail ##s , pictures , he actually seen him grow , so it turned out to be okay .
[unused1] [unused2] the ma ##rs express on its way on a seven ##- ##mont ##h journey to the red planet , contains really two spacecraft .
[unused1] [unused2] it also has a land ##er known as be ##ag ##le two , named after ch ##ar ##les car win which he sailed to the island and went into its bit of fame .
[unused1] [unused2] this is the first euro ##pe ##an mission to ma ##rs .
[unused1] [unused2] you ' ##ll recall de ##ce ##mber of 1988 1988 - ##- 1998 , i should say , the ma ##rs polar land ##er had a very unsuccessful conclusion to its flight to the red planet .
[unused1] [unused2] president bush is going to be meeting with several a ##rab leaders .
[unused1] [unused2] that happens next hour in a summit focusing on an is ##rae ##li ##- ##pal ##est ##inian peace initiative .
[unused1] [unused2] are you optimistic that president bush is actually going to , at this time , take the steps and say what has to be said to remove the s ##ke ##pticism that the a ##rab leaders are bringing to the summit ?
[unused1] [unused2] all 225 people aboard were killed .
[unused1] [unused2] a pair of la ##ci pet ##erson ' ##s missing shoes could be very important evidence in s ##cott ' ##s murder trial .
[unused1] [unused2] no sign of g ##era ##gos or pet ##erson in court yesterday when a judge was considering whether to un ##sea ##l warrant ##s obtained before s ##cott pet ##erson ' ##s arrest .
[unused1] [unused2] pet ##erson awaiting trial in the murder of his wife lace sand their un ##born son .
[unused1] [unused2] in the a ##f ##rica ##n nation of ni ##ger ##ia , an is ##lam ##ic court delayed the appeal of a woman condemned to death by s ##ton ##ing .
[unused1] [unused2] the court says it will not hear this case until late au ##gus ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] the 31 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old mother of three was convicted in march of having sex outside of marriage .
[unused1] [unused2] three other ni ##ger ##ians also face s ##ton ##ing deaths for the same crime .
[unused1] [unused2] the prosecution of pre ##mar ##ital or extra ##mar ##ital sex is not quite as rare as you might think .
[unused1] [unused2] our next guest this morning faced 100 lashes for pre ##mar ##ital sex in p ##aki ##stan .
[unused1] [unused2] she was there as a journalist in the wake of the 9 ##/ ##11 attacks .
[unused1] [unused2] as i understand it , you say you were facing a sentence of 100 lashes , had not yet been sentenced that ?
[unused1] [unused2] she resigned as chairman and c ##eo of ma ##rth ##a stew ##art living , o ##m ##ni ##media , the company that bears her name .
[unused1] [unused2] after pleading not guilty to a laundry list of charges brought by the justice department and the se ##c , inside ##r trading , o ##bs ##truction of justice , conspiracy to hide what they say is an illegal stock sale , we ' ##re talking about 4 ##, ##00 ##0 shares of stock that net ##ted her about $ 225 ##, ##00 ##0 .
[unused1] [unused2] en ##ron ' ##s bankruptcy cost thousands of people their jobs and their life savings and k ##en ##ny lay and the chairman and president , both of that company remain un ##ind ##icted .
[unused1] [unused2] world ##com once employed 80 ##, ##00 ##0 people and went broke on the largest corporate bankruptcy in the united states .
[unused1] [unused2] be ##rn ##ie ever ##s is living his life and un ##ind ##icted .
[unused1] [unused2] but the question is she being unfair ##ly single ##d out for prosecution ?
[unused1] [unused2] and i ' ##m sure we ' ##ll hear from many of you and we will select some of the responses and share them with you a bit later .
[unused1] [unused2] there ' ##s a concern with the huge series there this weekend with the ya ##nk ##ees coming to town that sa ##mmy would be suspended during that .
[unused1] [unused2] ma ##rth ##a stew ##art unfair ##ly single ##d out for prosecution or is she getting what she deserved ?
[unused1] [unused2] ji ##m in new yo ##rk , i ' ##ve des pie ##sed ma ##rth ##a stew ##art for years before the im ##c ##lone scandal , but all this prosecution does is how bias prosecutors are when they deal with m ##og ##ul ##s who strip the hopes of investors .
[unused1] [unused2] j ##oe in mi ##chi ##gan , prose ##cute , when your ski ##t in life is pro ##fe ##ssing trust and integrity and you violate that re ##sp ##ons ##ili ##bit ##y to your believing public , then you should be done .

[unused1] [unused2] we begin tonight talking about the way the justice system deals with those accused or suspected of terrorism , and we ' ##ll talk more about that in just a moment .
[unused1] [unused2] first , though with some believe is a case in point from ta ##mp ##a , fl ##ori ##da , sa ##mu ##el a ##rian ##na a former college professor in fl ##ori ##da who was arrested in f ##eb ##ru ##ary and charged of being a north am ##eric ##a head of a pale ##st ##inian group is ##lam ##ic ji ##had .
[unused1] [unused2] he was told today he will have his d ##ma ##i court .
[unused1] [unused2] two of the indicted men are out on bond , but sa ##mie ##l a ##ryan and other defendant are held without bond which is to say they will stay in jail until the trial starts in roughly 18 months .
[unused1] [unused2] president l ##in ##co ##ln dealt with it during the civil war , f ##. ##d ##. ##r ##.
[unused1] [unused2] did in world war ii , and it is often true that decisions made in the heat of a moment , a war or after an attack look pretty good at the time , not so good as time passes .
[unused1] [unused2] former prosecutor and about the last person on the planet that you would ever call a ##bly ##ing liberal .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : her marketing vision also included km ##art a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy .
[unused1] [unused2] the celebrity indicted on charges stem ##ming from the sale of im ##c ##lone stock .
[unused1] [unused2] stew ##art and former im ##c ##lone c ##eo sa ##m wa ##ks ##al shared a broker who now also faces charges of o ##bs ##truction of justice and per ##ju ##ry .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : after stew ##art was charged by federal authorities wed ##nes ##day , her lawyers issued a statement in which they said , quote , ma ##rth ##a stew ##art has done nothing wrong .
[unused1] [unused2] if she lied , then that is the o ##bs ##truction of justice charge .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : stew ##art is vow ##ing to clear her name of the charges .
[unused1] [unused2] when we sat down to lunch , she had put out these beautiful ch ##op sticks which i commented or ##ion .
[unused1] [unused2] sa ##m wa ##ks ##al , founder and former considers o of im ##c ##lone is scheduled to be sentenced today .
[unused1] [unused2] wa ##ks ##al could be fined $ 3 ##. ##5 million , facing a maximum of 75 years in prison , expected , though , to receive about six to seven years .
[unused1] [unused2] the charges related to her sale of im ##c ##lone stock .
[unused1] [unused2] sa ##m wa ##ks ##al , sentenced , 10 ##: ##00 a ##. ##m ##. , local time here in new yo ##rk .
[unused1] [unused2] up first , on ` ##` c ##nn live today ' ##' , sent ##encing this hour in the case of sa ##m wa ##ks ##al , the man at the center of the ma ##rth ##a stew ##art scandal .
[unused1] [unused2] c ##nn financial news correspondent ch ##ris hunting ##ton is outside the federal courthouse where sent ##encing is underway .
[unused1] [unused2] this morning ha ##mas vows revenge for an is ##rae ##li missile attack .
[unused1] [unused2] is ##rae ##li hospital gun ships fired on a j ##eep in g ##az ##a .
[unused1] [unused2] the strike targeted a ha ##mas leader .
[unused1] [unused2] and two other people were killed including a mother and bodyguard .
[unused1] [unused2] two is ##rae ##li helicopter air strikes against pale ##st ##inian targets , ha ##mas targets in g ##az ##a .
[unused1] [unused2] a number of people have been killed in the first airs ##tri ##ke , two pale ##st ##inian ##s were killed , a mother and a child apparently .
[unused1] [unused2] a ha ##mas leader was injured in that strike .
[unused1] [unused2] in the second a ##pa ##che helicopter airs ##tri ##ke that occurred within the past hour or so , we ' ##re now told by pale ##st ##inian ##s , three people died , 33 others were wounded , six are in critical condition , three dead were civilians , according to pale ##st ##inian sources .
[unused1] [unused2] sa ##m wa ##ks ##al has been sentenced to more that seven years in prison , ordered to pay $ 4 million in fines and back taxes in connection with the inside ##r trading scandal .
[unused1] [unused2] he is now getting word of his sentence from the federal judge .
[unused1] [unused2] seven years in prison , actually more than seven years in prison , $ 4 million in fines and back taxes , a story we ' ##ve been following here on c ##nn throughout the morning .
[unused1] [unused2] in g ##az ##a , a pair of is ##rae ##li gun ship attack , aerial attacks that have threatened to der ##ail the road map to peace , as it is called .
[unused1] [unused2] in the first attack , a car carrying ran ##tis ##si , a senior member of the ha ##mas group , a militant organization , was targeted .
[unused1] [unused2] he survived , with wound , but two people were killed .
[unused1] [unused2] 27 others were injured in that attack .
[unused1] [unused2] the second attack occurred after some rocket firing ##s aimed , apparently , toward the is ##rae ##lis , apparently in retaliation .
[unused1] [unused2] the white house saying , and the president directly quoted as saying , he was deeply troubled by that initial attack .
[unused1] [unused2] still no reaction to the second attack .
[unused1] [unused2] the president , quoted by a ##ri fl ##ei ##scher , his spokesman , is saying he ' ##s concerned the strike will under ##mine efforts by pale ##st ##inian authorities to bring an end to terrorist attacks and does not contribute to the security of is ##rae ##l .
[unused1] [unused2] clearly some frustration with the s ##har ##on government in is ##rae ##l in the wake of these attacks in g ##az ##a .
[unused1] [unused2] this shows some of the layers effects scientists find so interesting , captured by the ma ##rs global survey ##er , which has been in orbit since march of 1999 , one of the more successful missions na ##sa has ever staged to the red planet .
[unused1] [unused2] na ##sa hopes they ' ##ll do well today with the launch of the first of a pair of identical r ##overs headed to the red planet .
[unused1] [unused2] they ' ##ll arrive in j ##anu ##ary .
[unused1] [unused2] it ' ##s only then a mission to the red planet is possible .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : the twin missions to hunt for signs of life are set for a journey of a quarter billion miles , carrying identical red planet r ##overs .
[unused1] [unused2] they will enter the atmosphere on opposite sides of the planet in j ##anu ##ary and then deploy parachute ##s and air bags to cushion their arrival on the r ##ust ##- ##color ##ed surface .
[unused1] [unused2] in 1999 , the ma ##rs polar land ##er was supposed to arrive alive by using
[unused1] [unused2] em ##bat ##tled im ##c ##lone founder sa ##m wa ##ks ##al sentenced to more than seven years in prison for inside ##r trading .
[unused1] [unused2] we understand there has been an explosion there .
[unused1] [unused2] this right now , again , following up in the last few days of violent activity we ' ##ve seen in the wake of what was widely perceived to be as progress in the peace process .
[unused1] [unused2] we understand that a bus has been - ##- exploded .
[unused1] [unused2] we are now hearing once again , this coming to us off associated press wires there was an explosion there and we understand that several people have been killed .
[unused1] [unused2] and this being the latest in a series of what has become an almost customary t ##it for ta ##t exchange of violent activity .
[unused1] [unused2] last week , if you may recall , there was a strike on afraid in which a number of is ##rae ##li soldiers killed , that executed by coordinated group of is ##lam ##ic ji ##had as well as al a ##k satisfy martyr brigades , and ha ##mas all claiming responsibility for that and the strike ordered by s ##har ##on against the pale ##st ##inian leadership going , targeting a top leader , m ##r ##. ran ##tis ##si who escaped the helicopter rocket attack on his motor ##ca ##de .
[unused1] [unused2] however , two others who were there did die .
[unused1] [unused2] this now , this happened over the weekend and then this morning , war ##e hearing it appear as though perhaps there has been another re ##tale ##r to strike of some kind .
[unused1] [unused2] all we can tell you , there was an explosion on a bus in j ##erus ##ale ##m in ventral - ##- central j ##erus ##ale ##m .
[unused1] [unused2] a number of people killed , perhaps several people being killed in the explosion , which happened just moments ago .
[unused1] [unused2] once again , we ' ##re trying to get ah ##old of our mi ##ke ha ##nna , who was just with us on the phone .
[unused1] [unused2] i believe mi ##ke is over in j ##erus ##ale ##m in the bureau working the telephone ##s , trying to get as much information as he can and once be ##he gets something we ' ##ll deliver it to you .
[unused1] [unused2] president bush called upon the world to stop terrorism after a suicide bomb attack on a bus in j ##erus ##ale ##m today .
[unused1] [unused2] 16 people were killed .
[unused1] [unused2] at least 70 were injured .
[unused1] [unused2] shortly afterward , is ##rae ##l killed seven people in g ##az ##a , two of them members of ha ##mas .
[unused1] [unused2] mi ##ke ha ##nna in j ##erus ##ale ##m , but first , going to k ##elly wall ##ace in k ##ba s ##da where there ' ##s more helicopter attacks tonight .
[unused1] [unused2] a massive man ##hun ##t underway where a rap ##ist is targeting children .
[unused1] [unused2] we talked with the lieutenant in mi ##ami and there is big time concern in the she ##nan ##do ##ah neighborhood , southwestern portion of mi ##ami .
[unused1] [unused2] yeah , there ' ##s a little tension between the house majority leader , to ##m delay , and his successor as house majority whip and his former deputy , ll ##oy ##d blunt , kind of came to light when ` ##` the washing ##ton post ' ##' had a front ##- ##page story showing disagreement on the provision , delay had it taken out .
[unused1] [unused2] maybe they ' ##re j ##oss ##ling for who ' ##s going to be the next speaker .
[unused1] [unused2] i do n ##' ##t think den ##nis has ##ter ##t plans to step down soon anyway .
[unused1] [unused2] some of the national democratic operative ##s think j ##oh ##n ed ##ward ##s is going to run for president and that he ought to get out and concentrate on being reelected senator of north car ##olin ##a which w ##o n ##' ##t be easy .
[unused1] [unused2] slaughter in con ##go .
[unused1] [unused2] a month of blood ##let ##ing between rival tribes has already killed 500 people .
[unused1] [unused2] for a while , the world focused on the war in i ##ra ##q .
[unused1] [unused2] now the spotlight turns to the conflict in the middle east .
[unused1] [unused2] a massacre of massive proportions is un ##rave ##ling in a ##f ##rica , and most of the world is turning a blind eye .
[unused1] [unused2] international relief agency estimate that more than 3 million people have died in what ' ##s often dubbed a ##f ##rica ' ##s first world war .
[unused1] [unused2] it is , in fact , the dead ##liest conflict since world war ii and has been going on for five years .
[unused1] [unused2] but the land is home to other natural g ##ems being fought over .
[unused1] [unused2] the war there , a direct spill ##over from the 1994 civil war in r ##wan ##da , where government ##- ##led militia slaughtered an estimated 800 ##, ##00 ##0 opposition , and opposition s ##ym ##path ##izer ##s in about 100 days .
[unused1] [unused2] up next for investigators , to try to search sediment on the bottom of the pond located just outside f ##red ##rick , not far from washing ##ton , d ##. ##c ##. it ' ##s part of the investigation into the deadly ant ##hra ##x attacks in the fall of 2001 in which five people were killed .
[unused1] [unused2] ha ##mas was founded in 1988 by a blind para ##ple ##gic c ##ler ##ic who was influenced by the is ##lam ##ic m ##us ##lim brother ##hood , with backing from is ##rae ##l , he set up s ##hari ##ties in the improve ##ris ##hed strip in the 1970s .
[unused1] [unused2] the ex ##tre ##mism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks .
[unused1] [unused2] unfortunately , those same charitable organizations , those same charity committees that fun ##nel the funds to need ##ier pale ##st ##inian ##s , also serve to support terrorist attacks .
[unused1] [unused2] is ##rae ##l and the united states say a ##ra ##fa ##t has not been tough enough on terrorism , and have attempted to force him out of the current peace process .
[unused1] [unused2] he is not telling them to di ##sband and regulate their weapons , so i have no faith in the ability of a ##bu maze ##n to put terror aside .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : settlers call the just concluded is ##rae ##li ##- ##ame ##rica ##n - pale ##st ##inian summit a surrender , and were not impressed .
[unused1] [unused2] ha ##mas and other pale ##st ##inian militant group rejected a ##bba ##s ' call to end their attacks with a deadly raid on an is ##rae ##li army outpost in g ##az ##a .
[unused1] [unused2] we are all saying that the resistance will continue despite the summit in a ##qa ##ba .
[unused1] [unused2] is ##rae ##l re ##tal ##iated on ha ##mas , namely al ##- ##rant ##iss ##i , it missed him and killed civilians .
[unused1] [unused2] translator : ha ##mas will not drop our weapons , even if all leaders are assassinated .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : since the second in ##ti ##fa ##da began in 2000 , over 700 is ##rae ##lis have been killed , during the same time there have been more than 2 ##, ##00 ##0 pale ##st ##inian deaths according to the red c ##res ##cent .
[unused1] [unused2] including ha ##mas leaders targeted for assassination .
[unused1] [unused2] if you want an end to terrorism , if you want an end to violence , you have to give people hope and you have to give them a stake in the political process .
[unused1] [unused2] i think that ha ##mas is ready to join the political process , however , if the only price for the political price is you must fight ha ##mas , if that ' ##s what they are requiring a ##bu maze ##n to do , they are almost man ##dating that he will fail .
[unused1] [unused2] it lost $ 86 ##2 million in the first quarter , but that ' ##s much better than the retailer did a year ago when it was under bankruptcy protection .
[unused1] [unused2] the lady at the pen ##tag ##on saying she was leaving , saying it had been an honor serving her post but she ' ##s leaving for personal reasons .
[unused1] [unused2] f ##rank k ##eat ##ing leaving a commission set up to look into allegations of sex abuse in the cat ##hol ##ic church , he decided to quit after he made comments comparing un ##co ##oper ##ative church bishops to la co ##sa no ##sta , other folks , a ##ri fl ##ei ##scher .
[unused1] [unused2] you can e ##- ##mail us - ##- this done count , sorry .
[unused1] [unused2] and now joining us by phone from liver ##pool with more on the ha ##rry pot ##ter he ##ist is car ##olin ##e for ##ham , press officer with the mercy side police .
[unused1] [unused2] as you mentioned , if anyone is seen to be selling these on the black market they will be prosecuted .
[unused1] [unused2] we have police officers looking for them and will prose ##cute anyone seen selling them or buying them .
[unused1] [unused2] can ##ada is on the path to becoming the third country to allow gay marriage .
[unused1] [unused2] the federal government will not appeal the court ruling that cleared the way for same ##- ##sex unions .
[unused1] [unused2] prime minister j ##ean ch ##ret ##ien says the government will now draft legislation legal ##izing gay marriages .
[unused1] [unused2] as we ' ##ve been reporting , only within the past hour or so , there ' ##s been a shooting incident in central is ##rae ##l , not far from the west bank .
[unused1] [unused2] a 7 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old is ##rae ##li girl has died .
[unused1] [unused2] two others , her father apparently and another sister , have been wounded in this incident .
[unused1] [unused2] they were jumping in the sea when they saw the rescue ##rs were on the way .
[unused1] [unused2] the ##lma gut ##ier ##rez telling the story of the k ##ram ##ers meeting k ##ram ##er .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : mark and den ##ise are going to chin ##a to pick up a baby girl .
[unused1] [unused2] they ' ##re heading to q ##uin ##n j ##oe .
[unused1] [unused2] we understand that ' ##s where the sa ##rs epidemic started from and we ' ##re going right to the heart .
[unused1] [unused2] the people that gave birth to you are not necessarily your mom and dad .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : the k ##ram ##ers must wait and travel to another town for a ##bby .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : finally the k ##ram ##ers meet a ##bby .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : they know little about their little girl , found by the side of the road days after she was born .
[unused1] [unused2] well , it is our turn to meet the k ##ram ##ers back in the u ##. ##s ##. after their journey to chin ##a to bring home the newest and cute ##st perhaps , member of their family , in los angel ##es , the proud parents of 11 m ##nt ##h a ##bi ##gai ##l k ##ram ##er .
[unused1] [unused2] and we put in a call to the agency .
[unused1] [unused2] in mi ##chi ##gan , a second straight night and into this morning , hundreds of people have been riot ##ing in bent ##on harbor .
[unused1] [unused2] a man on a motorcycle was killed while being chased about i police , the violence broke out .
[unused1] [unused2] the head of the cat ##hol ##ic church in p ##hoe ##ni ##x , a ##riz ##ona , bishop th ##oma ##s o ##' ##bri ##en has resigned .
[unused1] [unused2] just one day after being charged with a f ##elo ##ny .
[unused1] [unused2] he is accused of leaving the scene of a fatal accident .
[unused1] [unused2] earlier this month o ##' ##bri ##en narrowly escaped prosecution over his handling of sexual abuse allegations against priests .
[unused1] [unused2] well , sex abuse by priests remains an issue in the cat ##hol ##ic church in the united states and it is certain to be an issue as bishops gather tomorrow in s ##t ##. lo ##ui ##s for their semi ##ann ##ual meeting .
[unused1] [unused2] under a charter approved last year by the national conference of cat ##hol ##ic bishops , diocese officials will report allegations of sexual abuse of a minor to public authorities .
[unused1] [unused2] past , present or future sexual abuse of a minor will lead to removal from the ministry .
[unused1] [unused2] no priest or de ##acon ##s who sexually abuse a minor may be transferred to another des ##ies .
[unused1] [unused2] as the bishops get ready for this important meeting tomorrow , are you satisfied that they have taken all the appropriate steps to deal with the abuse issue ?
[unused1] [unused2] then when they ' ##re ready to breed they go to the w ##b .
[unused1] [unused2] but they turned it into an empire , what s ##hir ##ley temple could have done .
[unused1] [unused2] they ' ##re not just sitting there hiring people to do their business .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : wolf , the government will announce a plea agreement that was reached with an oh ##io truck driver who allegedly has ties to al q ##ae ##da , and the driver ' ##s name is im ##an f ##er ##ris , and according to government sources al q ##ae ##da leader , k ##hale ##d she ##ik ##h m ##oh ##am ##med told investigators that f ##er ##ris ' ##s order to sur ##ve ##il the br ##ook ##lyn bridge was the ultimate goal of trying to cut the suspension bridge ' ##s cables and he was involved in a plot to drive a truck loaded with explosives onto an airport ta ##rma ##c to blow up a plane .

[unused1] [unused2] the ` ##` l ##. ##a ##. times ' ##' reporting that negotiations continuing and will resume tomorrow .
[unused1] [unused2] now , from the is ##rae ##li perspective , that also means they would expect pale ##st ##inian authority to fairly quickly begin to di ##sar ##m and di ##sman ##tle organizations like ha ##mas in particular .
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : in days of yo ##re , an en ##gli ##sh prince , a king in waiting would be charging off to battle on a horse , just before his 21st birthday , prince will ##iam is chasing a polo ball , such of what has become of the br ##itis ##h monarchy over time .
[unused1] [unused2] those who we ##pt when his mother , princess di an ##na , died , apparently transfer ##ed their affection to her eldest son .
[unused1] [unused2] he is part teen idol , part king in the making , but unlike his father , prince ch ##ar ##les , who is likely to pre ##cede him to the throne , this prince sustain ##s - ##- di ##s ##dain ##s being called your royal high ##ness , signing his name , will ##iam wa ##les .

[unused1] [unused2] the na ##sa and the euro ##pe ##an space agency both launch missions to ma ##rs this month sending r ##overs and ash ##ters to probe the red planet .
[unused1] [unused2] one of the big questions about ma ##rs is when or whether humans will ever be able to visit .
[unused1] [unused2] it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon .
[unused1] [unused2] so what ' ##s the difficulty in being able to go to ma ##rs ?
[unused1] [unused2] then if we stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three years .
[unused1] [unused2] the communications conditions once you ' ##re on ma ##rs , just to talk to people on earth , there ' ##s a 20 minute delay in the conversation .
[unused1] [unused2] well , first of all , the spacecraft would not be launched from earth .
[unused1] [unused2] you ' ##d have to launch is from in space already , which means we would have to build it in space .
[unused1] [unused2] then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth ' ##s orbit all the way to ma ##rs .
[unused1] [unused2] the bigger issue is once we get there , we ca n ##' ##t carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years , so we ' ##re going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet .
[unused1] [unused2] looks like it will be some time before we make our way to ma ##rs .
[unused1] [unused2] he got married .
[unused1] [unused2] my focus is on re ##- ##ele ##cting president bush and dick ch ##ene ##y next year , the convention is going to be here in the city of new yo ##rk .
[unused1] [unused2] there ' ##s a new poll out this morning , a ##b ##c news washing ##ton post poll that suggests that most am ##eric ##ans would support u ##. ##s ##. military action against i ##ran in order to keep the country from acquiring nuclear weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] according to the survey , 56 % said they would back military force block i ##ran from developing nuclear weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] would you support the use of military force to block i ##ran from developing nuclear weapons ?
[unused1] [unused2] i think if we ' ##re going to get this terror thing over ##with , i think we need to clear the countries that house them .
[unused1] [unused2] it would be deadly to let i ##ran let their hands on nuclear weapons employ i would support any action .
[unused1] [unused2] ka ##y j ##ones in water ##ford , connect ##ic ##ut , sure , let ' ##s invade i ##ran .
[unused1] [unused2] w ##ior already over there , besides the biggest cost us to next to the loss of life is transporting our troops overseas .
[unused1] [unused2] nuclear weapons in i ##ran , hope - ##- and buzz writes no one wants to see a war , but no one upon ##s to see another se ##pt ##em ##ber 11th even more .
[unused1] [unused2] especially a nuclear se ##pt ##em ##ber 11th .
[unused1] [unused2] i would support military action in i ##ran if it helps to stab ##ilize that area of the world .
[unused1] [unused2] we ' ##re told the r ##uss ##ian president v ##lad ##im ##ir put ##in was greeted by prince ch ##ar ##les as he arrived in lo ##ndon today .
[unused1] [unused2] his private plane arrived at heat ##hr ##ow airport .
[unused1] [unused2] put ##in and his wife left for the official reception that you ' ##re seeing now here in central lo ##ndon .
[unused1] [unused2] first time for r ##uss ##ian head of state to visit br ##ita ##in .
[unused1] [unused2] both of my generation and br ##ita ##in have special pause to remember the unacceptable sacrifice the r ##uss ##ian people made to defeat f ##ascism in the second world war .
[unused1] [unused2] nothing , not even the fact that our countries became est ##ranged in the war ' ##s aftermath , has ever dim ##med our memory of the scale of your loss .
[unused1] [unused2] when i visited your country in 1994 , i recall saying to president ye ##lts ##in that he and i spent most of our lives believing such a visit would never happen .
[unused1] [unused2] although , the tragic loss of br ##itis ##h lives today reminds us all of the difficulties to be faced .
[unused1] [unused2] first , a big hearing tomorrow in the s ##cott pet ##erson case .
[unused1] [unused2] then the te ##xa ##s woman accused of hitting a man with her car , driving home about him stuck to her windshield and leaving him there to die .
[unused1] [unused2] what drove him to become a serial rap ##ist and to jump bail in the middle of the trial .
[unused1] [unused2] he was arrested in j ##une after he he - ##- jumped trial on bail .
[unused1] [unused2] raped while in state care , pregnant .
[unused1] [unused2] she did n ##' ##t become pregnant by choice , she was raped , police say in a group home overseen by the state of fl ##ori ##da .
[unused1] [unused2] since she ' ##s incapable of make her own decision , a fl ##ori ##da judge based his decision on below to give birth on the recommendation .
[unused1] [unused2] still und ##ec ##ided , an appeal by governor j ##eb bush , who wants the guardian a ##point ##ed for the f ##etus .
[unused1] [unused2] last month in mi ##ami , a judge ordered an abortion for another severely disabled raped woman who had been living this a state ##- ##re ##gu ##lated home .
[unused1] [unused2] of course , according to the guardian , she ' ##s very worried about that , too , and she has warned the court that she hopes the mother will be placed in a better home when all of this is over , one where she is far better protected than she was by the state in a home where police say she was raped .
[unused1] [unused2] is it doing anything to tighten up security in these places with respect defense ##less people are being attacked ?
[unused1] [unused2] reporter : well , first of all , regarding the rape , they hope to find out who the father is once she gives birth because they will analyze d ##na from the baby in order to try to determine pat ##ern ##ity in this case .
[unused1] [unused2] that is certainly true and know a ##aro ##n ton ##kin and according to to ` ##` van ##ity fair , ' ##' he ' ##s at the heart of half a dozen investigations with fraud and angry investor lawsuits a ##- ##ple ##nt ##y .
[unused1] [unused2] what ' ##s interesting , i mean , reading the article , basically a lot of the celebrities paid by him to attend charity functions .
[unused1] [unused2] that ' ##s one of the things that was most surprising to me was in learning that in one of the - ##- one major fund ##- ##raiser , for instance , honoring former president c ##lint ##on , former president for ##d paid by m ##r ##. ton ##kin and s ##yl ##ves ##ter s ##tl loan was paid .
[unused1] [unused2] one of them being an i ##rs investigation into several million dollars worth of cash and gift that is he gave to many many ho ##lly ##wood celebrities .
[unused1] [unused2] we begin with s ##trom th ##ur ##mond the man who set an endure ##ance record for politics died last night in his hometown of edge ##field , south car ##olin ##a .
[unused1] [unused2] he won his first election in 1928 , the office of the county superintendent .
[unused1] [unused2] services and tribute ##s for two political figures who died this week .
[unused1] [unused2] a funeral today for les ##ter mad ##dox who died wed ##nes ##day .
[unused1] [unused2] he was a se ##gration ##ist who once closed a restaurant he owned rather ha ##n serve a ##f ##rica ##n ##- ##ame ##rica ##ns .
[unused1] [unused2] and may ##nard jack ##son lies in state today at his all ##ah matter .
[unused1] [unused2] former president bill c ##lint ##on expect to attend the funeral tomorrow .
[unused1] [unused2] and the pope will reportedly name a new head of the troubled b ##ost ##on arch ##dio ##ces ##e this week .
[unused1] [unused2] sea ##n pat ##rick o ##' ##mal ##ley , the bishop of palm beach , fl ##ori ##da , is expected to replace cardinal be ##rna ##rd law .

[unused1] [unused2] a wild ##fire in ca ##li ##fo ##rn ##ia forced hundreds of people from their homes .
[unused1] [unused2] no injuries have been reported thankful ##ly hat this time .
[unused1] [unused2] I mean , I ' ##d like to s - - ##- I ' ##d like to see the Greens run David Cobb again .
[unused1] [unused2] You know , I I mean obviously , if Sc ##hwa ##rz ##ene ##gger could run , he ' ##s got the name recognition , but I would be really surprised - ##- both to see him run and to see him win , but then again - ##- I was a little bit surprised when he won California , so
[unused1] [unused2] Future Elections Who do you think should run for President ##/ ##V ##ice President in 2008 , and why ?
[unused1] [unused2] She would be my s - - ##- well you know what , actually , I liked Dean a lot I must say , in this election .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , I was the one , who just happened to go home back in like nineteen eighty or something and saw Bill Clinton
[unused1] [unused2] I said , that guy could be President .
[unused1] [unused2] And I said , that guy could be president .
[unused1] [unused2] I said , you know , and I was before - ##- they said , well , I thought you supported George Bush , and I said , well I did support George Bush , but he does n ##' ##t know what he ' ##s doing and he needs to go .
[unused1] [unused2] So I went and volunteered for him and everything , and - ##- and I met Hillary , and and T ##ip ##per and Al , and and I almost got to meet him .

[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , I did go through - ##- West Virginia , one time through - ##- from Pittsburgh .
[unused1] [unused2] I had relatives that lived outside of Pittsburgh , once , and I went to Florida from there , so I did go through West Virginia .
[unused1] [unused2] And when I started there , in two thousand and two , there were only twenty ##- ##th ##ree employees , and to date , we have about a hundred and forty .
[unused1] [unused2] Um I worked - ##- we just recently um got bought by our our strategic partner - ##- so , who ##a , my radio .
[unused1] [unused2] Yes , we got uh purchased by our strategic partner , so um
[unused1] [unused2] Y ##' all recently got bought ?
[unused1] [unused2] Why ' ##re you , why ' ##re you at um - ##- um - ##- I ' ##m going to come over here tonight .
[unused1] [unused2] I started there in like - ##- uh I ' ##d say about - ##- what was that , I think it was - ##- two thousand two .
[unused1] [unused2] I started there , and we only had - ##- it was only like maybe thirty kids that that came to the - ##- to the uh community center .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah we got about - ##- we got about - ##- I ' ##d say - ##- girl , when I started , it was like four counselor ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Exactly we we got uh we got a lot of programs we got like basketball programs for the kids to play basketball , volleyball , um we take them out on a lot of trips , lot of field trips .
[unused1] [unused2] Every Wednesday , we go down to the uh River Bank Park .
[unused1] [unused2] So we could raise raise money , so we could take them to Great Adventure .
[unused1] [unused2] And with the constant merging with other banks ,
[unused1] [unused2] The uh ~ CEO we had before we merged with Nations Bank - ##- he uh - ##- he about ran as into the ground with some hedge funds that he had gone into .
[unused1] [unused2] And then , and then when we finish merging , they give the guy something like a twenty ##- ##fi ##ve million dollar package , and if he dies , his family still gets all the money .
[unused1] [unused2] And that was a long time ago , and we just c - oh , all that money , for just about bankrupt ##ing us .
[unused1] [unused2] They because they got some better insurance policies and some better - ##- bonus ##es that they paid out at the end of the month and - ##- you know , it was a little better .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m not Hispanic , but they uh I ' ##ve hired uh
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##ve got a a manager that - ##- you know , she ' ##s - ##- I def ##er to her on who thinks whether she thinks I should hire somebody or not .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##ve got a girl that I ' ##ve hired uh well , I hired her , let ' ##s see , about nine years ago - ##- It ' ##s a Hispanic girl but she speaks fluent English and Spanish , so she can work with both - ##- you know either language problem .

[unused1] [unused2] Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John Ash ##croft resign .
[unused1] [unused2] Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term ?
[unused1] [unused2] Who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ?
[unused1] [unused2] If you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ?
[unused1] [unused2] I I ' ##m sorry to see Colin Powell leave , leaving .
[unused1] [unused2] He he ' ##s very honest , he ' ##s very strong in his beliefs , and I ' ##m sorry to see him go .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m also sorry to see Tom Ridge resign ##ing .
[unused1] [unused2] he before nine eleven , he was - ##- he was on an advisory commit ##tal - ##- committee - ##- to the Go ##ver - to the President I guess , besides him running uh Pennsylvania , and then after nine eleven they appointed him you know , head of Homeland Security , and then created the
[unused1] [unused2] it ' ##s so soon - ##- since nine eleven , and he has been creating his own job , i - in essence , because it ' ##s such a new position .
[unused1] [unused2] Um - ##- one - ##- two of the men are from New York , one is a Head of - ##- the the - ##- who was there at nine eleven .
[unused1] [unused2] uh and just wipe it out ,
[unused1] [unused2] Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John Ash ##croft resign .
[unused1] [unused2] Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term ?
[unused1] [unused2] Who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ?
[unused1] [unused2] If you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ?
[unused1] [unused2] That ' ##s sort of unusual in these calls , in my experience so far .
[unused1] [unused2] Let ' ##s see , my first call I got was from Russia .
[unused1] [unused2] E ##h uh I - ##- I heard uh that Colin Powell wanted um - ##- to resign last year and they talked him out of it .
[unused1] [unused2] Oh th ##i - you were surprised that he yo - that he decided to step down .
[unused1] [unused2] They ' ##re appoint ##ing her ta - to a new position , and I was surprised about Ash ##croft .
[unused1] [unused2] Ash ##croft surprised me a little bit um but um I sort of started to think he might step down because evidently he was being he was considered somewhat of a lightning rod for um you know some of his more controversial stands and stuff so .
[unused1] [unused2] Where ' ##s he going to Commerce ?
[unused1] [unused2] Is that where he ' ##s headed ?
[unused1] [unused2] I think that ' ##s why Al ##- ##Q ##ae ##da - ##- took down the the uh twin towers .
[unused1] [unused2] So any thoughts on who you uh you would name ?
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- - ##- You know who I would name ?
[unused1] [unused2] So who would y - what would you appoint him to ?
[unused1] [unused2] Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John Ash ##croft resign .
[unused1] [unused2] Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet next term ?
[unused1] [unused2] Who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ?
[unused1] [unused2] If you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ?
[unused1] [unused2] And the one that , oh what ' ##s the - ##- the guy that , um - ##- Tom Ridge just re - resigned yesterday .
[unused1] [unused2] But I heard that they were going to - ##- one of the possible candidates is the the guy he used to be the chief of police of New York .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , the homeless people - ##- I guess , they need their shopping cart , so they kind of went elsewhere , so - ##- um - ##- I mean it ' ##s a small thing , but it was , they just figured out , they were - ##- you know , uh - ##- learning from experience on what they need to do in the - ##- city and - ##- I think he would be a good - ##- candidate for the Homeland Security , running that .
[unused1] [unused2] Um - ##- like , uh - ##- well , it was - ##- Colin Powell was Secretary , was he Secretary of State ?
[unused1] [unused2] And Con ##do ##lee ##zza Rice is going to step into that position , the way I understand it , uh .
[unused1] [unused2] Uh , do you think there is uh - ##- some other , uh like - ##- positions has to be has been - ##- has to be created , like uh - ##- for the next election .
[unused1] [unused2] Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term in office , and he has already started to appoint new people to his political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John Ash ##croft resign .

[unused1] [unused2] Who are they , and why do you think they should be appointed ?
[unused1] [unused2] If you were president , which national figures would you appoint to your cabinet and why ?
[unused1] [unused2] I think - ##- I think Rudy G ##iu ##lian ##i was a great mayor - ##- for nine eleven .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , I I ' ##m a New Yorker , and I got to tell you that I I think nine eleven I I think - ##- basically made him .
[unused1] [unused2] Exactly , exactly , I I think that nine eleven made him and
[unused1] [unused2] And if if if I do n ##' ##t think the rest of the country knows that , because they do n ##' ##t know what he did before nine eleven , because they do n ##' ##t pay any attention .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah I think I was - ##- I think I was - ##- I was on a cruise , and I put on the television uh when I got in at the six oh clock news , and bin ##go , there he is , uh resign ##ing as Governor of uh New Jersey .
[unused1] [unused2] I did n ##' ##t particularly like the the tone about the the religious uh - ##- side of - ##- the that election .
[unused1] [unused2] Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Lac ##i and their un ##born son , and he now faces the death penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ?
[unused1] [unused2] Okay , I - ##- have been following the trial , I do n ##' ##t know why , ever since this whole thing happened .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t think he ' ##s guilty and , I hope he does n ##' ##t get the death penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- finish , things were getting him down , uh you know , you know how it is , day after day though - ##- M - marriage is n ##' ##t all that wonderful .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t , I do n ##' ##t know why like his uh , the wife ' ##s or the mother said divorce is an option I think .
[unused1] [unused2] Not , you know , not murder and , oh , I mean , I do n ##' ##t know .
[unused1] [unused2] But you know what , it ' ##s like I think they did n ##' ##t want to find him guilty because remember when ~ O ##J was not found guilty ?
[unused1] [unused2] I - it just , I do n ##' ##t know what would happen if he was found guilty , but now I think they said that they wanted to prove that - ##- you know , okay , we ' ##re not going to let this guy walk , like , do n ##' ##t let this guy walk either , big high profile case .
[unused1] [unused2] Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Lac ##i and their un ##born son , and he now faces the death penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ?
[unused1] [unused2] Um , uh , Scott Peterson trial .
[unused1] [unused2] Where the trial ' ##s at .
[unused1] [unused2] And the trial ' ##s there .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , I heard something about it .
[unused1] [unused2] I think he got into an argument with her and he pushed her .
[unused1] [unused2] And I think she fell and maybe she hit her head or something and it killed her , so he panicked .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , because I was really - ##- I was n ##' ##t really following it that much because I was -
[unused1] [unused2] but - ##- - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- but I ' ##d love to have his hair - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- something just came off the ~ TV about the Scott trial .
[unused1] [unused2] I live in Red ##wood City , which they actually moved the trial here a couple months into it .
[unused1] [unused2] Where he had committed the murders , so .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , we ' ##re a pretty small town , so our newspaper covers it a lot .
[unused1] [unused2] Once they sentence him - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- I bet - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] Hopefully , you know , if he ' ##s guilty hopefully , you know , they find him guilty - ##- and hopefully they have evidence , you know .
[unused1] [unused2] Um , they brought the boat down , or a du ##plicate of the boat to , kind of , you know , get a feel for it but they had to remove it from Red ##wood City because people were putting flowers in it in - ##- memory of Lac ##i and , you know , planting flowers around it and stuff , so it was pretty interesting .
[unused1] [unused2] You know , we ' ##re close to the trial so of course it ' ##s going to be in the newspaper every single day .
[unused1] [unused2] So , it ' ##s , you know , and the trial , the , um , what is it called , the verdict , was actually read by audio over the ~ TV .
[unused1] [unused2] Is that - ##- is that the one where somebody called a news -
[unused1] [unused2] Because somebody had - ##- called the news people .
[unused1] [unused2] Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Lac ##i and their un ##born son , and he now faces the death penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ?
[unused1] [unused2] What kind of sent ##encing should Peterson receive ?
[unused1] [unused2] I did n ##' ##t really follow the trial very closely at all
[unused1] [unused2] we do n ##' ##t have , uh , cable so we purpose ##ly did n ##' ##t watch the trial , but I read about it on the internet .
[unused1] [unused2] he - ##- killed his wife when she was - ##- eight months pregnant and - ##- and dumped her in , uh - ##- the ocean , basically .
[unused1] [unused2] Oh , but the mistress had nothing to do with the murder ?
[unused1] [unused2] I hear though , that he ' ##s going to be - ##- the first person to be - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- um - ##- uh - ##- killed for a crime in California in like , thirty five years or something .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t know if they ' ##ve , I do n ##' ##t know if they ' ##ve - ##- um - ##- given him the death penalty yet .
[unused1] [unused2] But I think he would be the first in , in a really long time to actually - ##- be killed .
[unused1] [unused2] Um - ##- why , uh , now why did they decide that this was to be this big - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- out of this with the most he ##ino ##us crime in all of California ?
[unused1] [unused2] I mean I guess that ' ##s not how they decide who died , but it ' ##s because of the
[unused1] [unused2] they have many many worse crimes going on in California , parents killing their children and everything , that you would think - ##- would would , um - ##- you know , be
[unused1] [unused2] I never really got the whole - ##- watching it on ~ TV and and getting into the whole - ##- mystery of it because , in the end , the woman ' ##s dead and so is her child and - ##- and - ##- there ' ##s - ##- really no way of changing that I guess .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , uh , I think it ' ##s kind of strange how it was so public ##ized .
[unused1] [unused2] But it just am ##az ##es me that , uh , I think it ' ##s ridiculous how public ##ized - ##- how much publicity it got because - ##- I mean there ' ##s like human rights violations going on all around the world .
[unused1] [unused2] I mean there ' ##s like , genocide in Sudan right now but like , nobody talks about that .
[unused1] [unused2] Oh yeah and what ' ##s going on in , I know and people - ##- flock , flock to the store to buy all their - ##- all their foreign made goods and it ' ##s like what are you - ##- doing ?
[unused1] [unused2] Um - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- it ' ##s almost like , uh - ##- - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- diversion but it just seems like they just make it into like , like a soap opera for people to watch , you know ?
[unused1] [unused2] Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Lac ##i and their un ##born son , and he now faces the death penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he ' ##s been convicted of ?
[unused1] [unused2] How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ?
[unused1] [unused2] What kind of sent ##encing should Peterson receive ?
[unused1] [unused2] Uh , there there ' ##s something about this Scott Peterson trial , though , that the th - that I ca n ##' ##t I ca n ##' ##t recall hearing .
[unused1] [unused2] Did the - ##- are they still going to try to get him with , uh , the death penalty or are they - ##- - ##- or are they going to be content with just , uh , just , you know , giving him life , uh , have heard about that ?
[unused1] [unused2] When I first - ##- heard the case , or about it , I - ##- told myself , if he did do it ,
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , he probably did .
[unused1] [unused2] and I think he did ,
[unused1] [unused2] uh , if he did do it , I - ##- thought to myself , he will probably get - ##- the maximum sentence of whatever it is
[unused1] [unused2] Well , he he he probably will , yeah .
[unused1] [unused2] I c - but , now , I do n ##' ##t know that I would vote for a death penalty because I ' ##m not sure that a - ##- a death cancel ##s out a death .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m not - ##- - ##- I I do n ##' ##t know , and - ##- I would n ##' ##t really be able to vote - ##- on that because my father was killed at work .
[unused1] [unused2] Oh , I ' ##m sorry to hear that .
[unused1] [unused2] because they ' ##re - ##- I ' ##ve never totally - ##- believed - ##- that Peterson did this all by himself .
[unused1] [unused2] that if - ##- she had anything to do with this , I do n ##' ##t think he would ever tell .
[unused1] [unused2] Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Lac ##i and their un ##born son , and he now faces the death penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he ' ##s been convicted of ?
[unused1] [unused2] How closely did you follow the trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial ?
[unused1] [unused2] I I did n ##' ##t actually - ##- watch the trial very much , uh th - in fact , I did n ##' ##t watch the trial at all .
[unused1] [unused2] I read about it in the newspaper and things like that .
[unused1] [unused2] I - I think his motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend , but uh - - ##- kill his own first child that way is extraordinary .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , uh they ' ##re coming up to the sent ##encing , and I heard yesterday or read in the newspaper or something that his brother - ##- I guess it was on the television .
[unused1] [unused2] In the news , his brother was appealing - ##- for them to to sentence him to - ##- to prison for life rather than the death penalty , because - ##- he said he ' ##s a very good listener and he cares about people , and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison .
[unused1] [unused2] I know that he had done a lot of volunteer things before , and that was the one things that made me wonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebody else who did it .

[unused1] [unused2] Do you think Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s death will help or hurt the Israeli ##- ##P ##ales ##tin ##ian peace process ?
[unused1] [unused2] What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Ara ##fa ##t has died ?
[unused1] [unused2] Well , um , I would - I would have to start - - ##- I would have to start , generally , in stating - - ##- stating what I think is the problem and - ##- - with the Middle East and what - For me , one of the major problems is the fact that - ##- the - ##- United States government gives so much aid to the state of Israel .
[unused1] [unused2] In which , the state of Israel buys - ##- many expensive military weapons , ah , which is used to - ##- op ##press and - ##- to kill a lot of Palestinians .
[unused1] [unused2] And , um , Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t was kind of in a difficult position , because you have these , um , incredibly - ##- op ##pressed and in some ways imprisoned , uh , Palestinians , and if - ##- Ara ##fa ##t had n ##' ##t , um , tried to stand up - ##- and help them and - and fight for their rights , then - ##- m - they would n ##' ##t have respected Ara ##fa ##t , but then again , you know , he could n ##' ##t be too friendly with the West , um , and , um , and so he did the best he could , I think .
[unused1] [unused2] Um , well , there ' ##s been a couple where - ##- they ' ##ve - they talked about the Cabinet - ##- for - ##- Bush , and Bush has been , um , you know , selecting new Cabinet members and - ##- all of the new members are people that I ' ##m - I do n ##' ##t really know very well .
[unused1] [unused2] Other topics - ##- you know , usually about the election that - - ##- that , um , I did have - ##- a lot of things , um , to say .

[unused1] [unused2] What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Ara ##fa ##t has died ?
[unused1] [unused2] Well , um , where they were going to , uh , give them , like , ninety ##- ##si ##x percent of the G ##a - of - of Gaza and he said that he wanted all hundred percent .
[unused1] [unused2] I really , truly do and now it ' ##s a - a situation where , with his passing , um , I think there ' ##s a real , um , new opening , a new possibility for - - ##- some extremely positive steps to come forward out of this - ##- I do think that the United States - ##- will probably be requested to be involved in the negotiation process and I understand that , I me - uh , because , um , I think - ##- both sides - ##- have a trust in the United States that make it -
[unused1] [unused2] They had those retreat ##s and things with the leaders ,

[unused1] [unused2] What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Ara ##fa ##t has died ?
[unused1] [unused2] I I think - ##- that , uh , he - ##- he ' ##s - ##- pretty much - ##- - ##- or he was pretty much - ##- following what he had always done , even as a young man , uh , back in Algeria - ##- when - when he led the - ##- terrorist attacks against the French to kick them out of - ##- Algeria .
[unused1] [unused2] E ##v - everything kind of stopped when - - ##- when he became president and all , uh , activity regarding - ##- Israel , Palestine stopped .
[unused1] [unused2] By going into their territory and building these walls or building settlements - ##- pushing the Palestinians out and - ##- Palestinians - ##- fight - ##- with rocks and - ##- sticks and - ##- Israeli ##s have their machine guns and bull ##do ##zers and - ##- I just - ##- t - really un ##pal ##ata ##ble that the - ##- whole idea , the - ##- the way they ' ##re going about - ##- this thing and - ##- I do n ##' ##t really feel qualified - ##- to say how it should be , but - ##- I - ##- see it - ##- being wrong to - ##- hurt children and - ##- innocent people .
[unused1] [unused2] Death of Ara ##fa ##t - ##LR ##B ##- 1 - ##R ##RB ##- Con ##tro ##vers ##ial P ##L ##O leader Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t died in a Paris hospital last week .

[unused1] [unused2] What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Ara ##fa ##t has died ?
[unused1] [unused2] but it was n ##' ##t actually for peace but was to try to find a way to - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- send - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- the Israeli ##s out of Jerusalem in the areas that they wanted .
[unused1] [unused2] I think that , um , his death - ##- marks a beginning of trying to find somebody that - ##- really wants peace .
[unused1] [unused2] If you know the Bible well you would know that there ' ##s always going to be a conflict there .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t think that we should get involved to a level , a point where we ' ##re sending people over there and , um , trying to - ##- help keep the peace or anything like that , um .
[unused1] [unused2] I think that now he ' ##s gone , his family is still around , and
[unused1] [unused2] And I agree that we should n ##' ##t send people over there .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##d like to - ##- I know that , you know , there ' ##s been problems , a lot of conflict over there , and it seems like no matter what ,
[unused1] [unused2] just like Iraq ye - eh , we try to go in and get peace and - and how long has it been and , I mean , I think Saddam needed to be removed but it ' ##s - - ##- there ' ##s just - ##- s - all these people that are going to follow him no matter what .
[unused1] [unused2] I think that it was a front - ##- for him to allow to to be accepted in an international community , but I think - ##- that his ultimate plans and goals were to to run the Israeli ##s out - ##- maybe closer to the Gaza strip , and to re ##- ##take Jerusalem - ##- and other cities near Jerusalem , and to , uh , up ##lift his people in a way that - ##- they could say , you know , we conquered the Israeli ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s a matter of , uh - ##- I mean , it ' ##s more than just land , it ' ##s a , um , conflict of - - ##- of , um , hatred , uh , and racism , I mean , eh , different types of people , um , they do n ##' ##t like each other ,

[unused1] [unused2] Do you think Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s death will help or hurt the Israeli ##- ##P ##ales ##tin ##ian peace process ?
[unused1] [unused2] What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Ara ##fa ##t has died ?
[unused1] [unused2] For example , when there was , uh , like , a - ##- decision against Iraq , the United States - ##- went directly - ##- to Iraq to - ##- - ##- for , eh , uh , an invasion - ##- and - ##- for - ##- whatever reasons - - ##- she even was out , uh , putting any attention to the United Nations , uh , like , uh , approval .
[unused1] [unused2] For example , before , eh , during Clinton , I believe at that time - ##- Clinton was trying hard - ##- to solve this problem and I believe at that time , if you remember , um , Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t - ##- and , uh , the prime minister of Israel , his name was Bar ##ak , they met together in the White House - ##- and - ##- they almost came to an agreement - ##- to solve this problem - ##- and during Clinton , eh , period - ##- they had , uh , this - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- Oslo - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- a - eh , agreement .
[unused1] [unused2] I think , the people , uh , the people that are in charge , the - eh , the people that run the governments there - ##- do need to sit down an - and - and be in touch with each other and if they need a media ##tor or something like that , that -
[unused1] [unused2] Criminal Trials ##/ ##P ##eter ##son Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Lac ##i and their un ##born son , and he now faces the death penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] There ' ##s been a lot of media coverage of the Peterson trial .
[unused1] [unused2] Why do you think this trial has been so public ##ized ?
[unused1] [unused2] What other criminal trials have gotten a lot of media attention , and why ?
[unused1] [unused2] What ' ##s the most memorable criminal trial you can recall ?
[unused1] [unused2] I - ##- I ' ##m calling you from New York City , Paul , it ' ##s a pleasure to meet you .
[unused1] [unused2] Have yo - how so , how do you feel about this Scott Peterson trial and all the publicity they ' ##re putting into it , and
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , well , I that ' ##s what I was g - my next question was , that was another big criminal criminal , uh , trial ,
[unused1] [unused2] he ' ##ll probably get some wa ##cky woman - ##- who wants to marry him ,
[unused1] [unused2] get married two or three times in there .
[unused1] [unused2] And , um , I think he s - m - was meeting women in the jail like that , too , when he was there , but he just got out of doing fifteen years and , you know , he was just , eh , Central Park , he had , uh , well , rough sex or something , with a woman in the park and they said he strangled her , or
[unused1] [unused2] Criminal Trials ##/ ##P ##eter ##son Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Lac ##i and their un ##born son , and he now faces the death penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] There ' ##s been a lot of media coverage of the Peterson trial .
[unused1] [unused2] Why do you think this trial has been so public ##ized ?
[unused1] [unused2] What other criminal trials have gotten a lot of media attention , and why ?
[unused1] [unused2] What ' ##s the most memorable criminal trial you can recall ?
[unused1] [unused2] Uh , what do you know about this Scott - ##- Peterson trial ?
[unused1] [unused2] Um , so when they found the baby , the baby of course had been - ##- they do n ##' ##t know if the baby was born , through delivery , or - ##- if maybe from um - ##- the corpse I guess
[unused1] [unused2] And they ' ##re making the determination if - ##- in fact he will get the death penalty , or life in prison .
[unused1] [unused2] But , actually they were trying to pass a law , and I do n ##' ##t know if it ever did take into effect , that if in fact a mother was killed , and pregnant , um - ##- for there to be a double murder charge .
[unused1] [unused2] And - ##- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were - ##- found guilty on both charges .
[unused1] [unused2] And - ##- so it ' ##s kind of up in the air now - ##- because he - ##- I believe he got first degree murder and - ##- um and then got man ##sla ##ughter on the baby .
[unused1] [unused2] So he did n ##' ##t get both first degree murders .
[unused1] [unused2] Where - ##- Um , I guess because he did n ##' ##t murder the baby directly .
[unused1] [unused2] And because of the the charge on the baby , they could n ##' ##t automatically give him the death penalty , but - ##- obviously there ' ##s enough - ##- um , complaints or whatever
[unused1] [unused2] And actually I do n ##' ##t even think they were married that long , maybe a year or two .
[unused1] [unused2] Elections Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election ?
[unused1] [unused2] Oh , so the topic is elections .
[unused1] [unused2] I know they ' ##re also - ##- I ' ##ve been reading some articles lately about they ' ##re - ##- thinking about , uh , uh , why should only a native born person be allowed to , uh , be President .
[unused1] [unused2] And , uh , well , I I - ##- I did read a a column today by , uh , a Hispanic fellow and , uh , he was n ##' ##t native born , he was from Cuba , and , uh , he stated that , uh , we he was in the fifth grade and and , uh , uh , he was taking - ##- no , I guess he was in middle school and he was taking a civic ##s class and and it was pointed out to him that , you know , he could never become President .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , you know , in one sense it is but then , I mean - ##- well , my grandparents came over , Ellis Island and everything , but when I think about , you know , a foreign person or maybe born in another country and coming here it do ##e - it does n ##' ##t seem right in one sense for - ##- for them to be able to be President of this country .
[unused1] [unused2] Elections Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election ?
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , I guess the elections , ah - ##- basically , who did you vote for , and the vice presidential candidates , and why , and I ' ##ll be honest with you
[unused1] [unused2] ever , I usually try to stay out of the main party , because I think , and this last election showed that both are very brutal .
[unused1] [unused2] It was a very brutal election .
[unused1] [unused2] and , ah - ##- I mean , and , and a lot of it has to do - ##- and then , I just did n ##' ##t know much , John Edwards seemed nice , but he just , you know , he was just , he just got elected to the Senate , and , I was n ##' ##t really familiar too much with hi - I mean , I think it ' ##s great that he got into the vice presidential role , but - ##- again , it ' ##s the whole parties that I ' ##m really not really I do n ##' ##t like their policies .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , you kind of hit on some of my sentiments , um , I ' ##m a fifty ##- ##ye ##ar - old black male , and this was my first election that I participated in .
[unused1] [unused2] And the reason was was that , ah , I ' ##m retired Air Force - ##- and before , ah , because I was in the military - ##- ah , did n ##' ##t did n ##' ##t really think that my vote , um , counted one way or the other , that ' ##s that was my thinking .
[unused1] [unused2] Yes , I feel very , very bad in regards to the , ah , nine ##- ##ele ##ven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
[unused1] [unused2] Elections Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election ?
[unused1] [unused2] Um , man I thought I , uh , put this whole election stuff behind me .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , I - in fact , I thought we already had a discussion on this , uh , about elections some time back , but I guess it was - ##- question was framed differently , I guess .
[unused1] [unused2] And , um , elections wore me down .
[unused1] [unused2] In fact , we just got back from Disney World , you know , about an hour ago and they ' ##re down there and they ' ##re but they ' ##re both , uh ,
[unused1] [unused2] and , um , but then - ##- Edwards fought back kind of - ##- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too , about the , uh , how he ' ##s a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions - ##- su ##ing insurance companies and , um , you know , there - there ' ##s - ##- bad stuff you hear about both of them that , you know , obviously they want to tell you
[unused1] [unused2] Elections Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election ?
[unused1] [unused2] So , uh the election , um - ##- the , um - ##- let ' ##s see , overall I felt - ##- j ##u - just give you a brief - ##- summary , I felt - ##- that - ##- John Kerry and Edwards were were pretty strong candidates and - ##- uh - ##- mm , I do n ##' ##t know , I guess just in terms of policy I did n ##' ##t - ##- I did n ##' ##t , uh , find - ##- that as compelling as just - ##- the personality of - ##- the different candidates .
[unused1] [unused2] And I - ##- felt like , h ##m - ##- if we ' ##re trying to , um - ##- make - ##- um - ##- the United States safer and more stable - ##- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody - ##- who is a little bit more - ##- of a politician in the sense that - ##- the , they care about diplomacy and - ##- uh , even though we may not - ##- give in to - ##- the will of the other nations present it in a nice ##r way .
[unused1] [unused2] And all the meetings he ' ##s missing , and just , you know , I think it ' ##s more of a status q ##uo for him .
[unused1] [unused2] Do you think , um - ##- the - ##- when the Republicans are campaigning - ##- they were saying that well , another attack on the U ##. ##S ##. is - ##- imminent , that it probably - ##- probably going to happen - ##- and - ##- um - ##- and - ##- they even went so far to say that if - ##- it ' ##s really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they ' ##re doing the best they can and - ##- I think Kerry would do the best he could .
[unused1] [unused2] But do you think , um - ##- that - ##- and this is n ##' ##t quite a political issue , but do you think that - ##- there ' ##s going to be another attack on the ~ US ?
[unused1] [unused2] Death of Ara ##fa ##t - ##LR ##B ##- 2 - ##R ##RB ##- P ##L ##O leader P ##L ##O leader Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t died in a Paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death .
[unused1] [unused2] What do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something ma ##lic ##ious - ##LR ##B ##- like poisoning - ##R ##RB ##- ?
[unused1] [unused2] What do you think of Israel ' ##s policies surrounding Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s illness and death ?
[unused1] [unused2] but it was n ##' ##t - ##- like , ah , was n ##' ##t Bush , I definitely would n ##' ##t send him , I do n ##' ##t think you want to have him in that part of the world right now .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , was good enough , just to show - ##- the Palestinian people - ##- that , uh you know , America does care somewhat - ##- that you ' ##ve lost your leader .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##d say my overall opinion is that - ##- this conflict is way past that time .
[unused1] [unused2] You know , it ' ##s been going on for all these many - ##- what ,
[unused1] [unused2] hundreds of years - ##- and a lot of people have lost their lives , and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they ' ##ve ever known - ##- on both sides Israeli and Palestinian , all they ' ##ve ever known is war .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction .
[unused1] [unused2] Death of Ara ##fa ##t - ##LR ##B ##- 2 - ##R ##RB ##- P ##L ##O leader P ##L ##O leader Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t died in a Paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death .
[unused1] [unused2] What do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something ma ##lic ##ious - ##LR ##B ##- like poisoning - ##R ##RB ##- ?
[unused1] [unused2] What do you think of Israel ' ##s policies surrounding Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s illness and death ?
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , I do n ##' ##t think he was poisoned .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , I I guess now that that he ' ##s he ' ##s died - ##- it ' ##ll be , uh , or it it should be a change for the ~ P ##L ##O
[unused1] [unused2] He he seems like a guy who is much more comfortable - ##- being under siege than in negotiating peace settlements .
[unused1] [unused2] You know , if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would ' ##ve killed him - ##- and if he did n ##' ##t make peace , eh , then he ' ##s considered , you know , the the warm ##ong ##ering , uh , man who w ##o n ##' ##t make peace , you know .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , I I do n ##' ##t remember who they sent , but they did send over some very - ##- low level state department person
[unused1] [unused2] And , uh , it would ' ##ve - ##- gone an - a little farther to encourage them to , you know , be willing to sit down at the table with us , at least , you know .
[unused1] [unused2] But , uh , at at least for the ceremony in Egypt I think , uh , I can understand that no one would want to go into - ##- Palestinian territory .
[unused1] [unused2] Death of Ara ##fa ##t - ##LR ##B ##- 2 - ##R ##RB ##- P ##L ##O leader P ##L ##O leader Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t died in a Paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death .
[unused1] [unused2] What do you think caused his illness , and could it have been something ma ##lic ##ious - ##LR ##B ##- like poisoning - ##R ##RB ##- ?
[unused1] [unused2] What do you think of Israel ' ##s policies surrounding Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s illness and death ?
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , okay , um , - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- lot of question - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- - ##- and , um , I - I do n ##' ##t think it was poisoning , even though I have n ##' ##t read - ##- a lot of articles about it .
[unused1] [unused2] He ' ##s - I mean , like , you know , let ' ##s - i - - ##- for - for all he did in his later years , eh , Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t was responsible for - ##- a good chunk of al - you know , a lot of - ##- Israeli dying - ##- i - you know .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , in other words eh , in other - ##- when - ##- after World War Two when they when - ##- basically the state of Israel was formed
[unused1] [unused2] Um , you know , you - e - - ##- granted , you know , there were there were Jewish people already living there , but - ##- all the Jewish people started going there and they j - basically just - you know , they just took over .
[unused1] [unused2] They ' ##re fi - they do n ##' ##t even know why they ' ##re fighting anymore .
[unused1] [unused2] And it ' ##s and it ' ##s it ' ##s you know , a war of at ##tri ##tion .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s either , you know , you may kill me , but I ' ##m going to kill all of you before - y - you know what I mean ?
[unused1] [unused2] There were - ##- two very strong - ##- militant groups that were Israeli and they - ##- committed a lot of terrorist acts ,
[unused1] [unused2] So , I mean , i - - ##- you know , uh , how we consider - ##- Ara ##fa ##t a terrorist , we also should consider that - ##- could ' ##ve been , in some ways , a reaction to some of the terrorism that was - ##- initially - ##- committed by the Israeli ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] But if Ara ##fa ##t had n ##' ##t been I do n ##' ##t know if he ' ##s - ##- directly - ##- been linked to Hamas ' acts , uh , but he was put in a - ##- pretty - ##- sticky situation having to negotiate - ##- the militants of - ##- Palestine - ##- the international leaders - ##- and if it if Hara - Ara ##fa ##t had n ##' ##t - ##- somehow app ##ease ##d - ##- the Hamas groups or the Palestinian militants , then - ##- he would ' ##ve been kicked out , overthrow ##n - ##- by - - ##- by the Palestinians .
[unused1] [unused2] Oh , forget about kicked out or overthrow ##n , he would ' ##ve been killed .
[unused1] [unused2] He was he was basically - ##- I mean , I ' ##ve read I ' ##ve read articles an - and - and - and - ##- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the Munich - ##- massacre - ##- th - you know , the Munich Olympic massacre th - the Is - the Israeli team .
[unused1] [unused2] Death of Ara ##fa ##t - ##LR ##B ##- 2 - ##R ##RB ##- P ##L ##O leader P ##L ##O leader Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t died in a Paris hospital last week , after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death .
[unused1] [unused2] What do you think of Israel ' ##s policies surrounding Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s illness and death ?
[unused1] [unused2] Well - ##- I , uh , I do n ##' ##t think there was anything ma ##lic ##ious , uh , in terms of his death - ##- uh , just looking at him these last , uh , couple of years uh , it seems like he had Alzheimer ' ##s or something .
[unused1] [unused2] They were doing all these talks in Camp David and and it should have just continued when B ##r - Bush came into office .
[unused1] [unused2] And then you got suicide bombing on the one side , and then you got Israel - ##- you know , it ' ##s like one day , you ' ##ll he - a bomb will go off , the next day Israel will do and air strike and - ##- you know , it ' ##s like going around in a circle .
[unused1] [unused2] my family ' ##s , uh , parents are deceased and most of - ##LR ##B ##- - ##LR ##B ##- them - ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- is , uh , passed my brothers all over , so her family ' ##s still younger - ##- and , uh , you know , just the odd sides .
[unused1] [unused2] So - ##- keep it together through thick and thin and - ##- when it comes to Thanksgiving we go up there and we celebrate .
[unused1] [unused2] to go out of the country as part of our New Year ' ##s
[unused1] [unused2] But um , actually , this year I - we ' ##re going - ##- uh My parents are also divorced , so it was always difficult because we had to , like , split Christmas .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##re actually , um , going to France for Christmas to have with my aunt , so -
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m leaving on Monday and coming back on the th ##irt ##iet ##h , so um ,
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m retired from full ##- ##time teaching ,
[unused1] [unused2] I think because the - one , you get laid off first p ##r - you know , first person to get laid off is going to be the arts and
[unused1] [unused2] And that ' ##s what ha - what is happening .
[unused1] [unused2] Um , actually , usually we ' ##re out of town so we do n ##' ##t attend our church .
[unused1] [unused2] Your g ##ran - you go to your grand ##ma ' ##s house .
[unused1] [unused2] But , still , uh , they go to , uh , grandmother ' ##s - ##- every Christmas .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s not like you just go and eat dinner a couple of hours and go home .
[unused1] [unused2] Do you travel to meet up with family or friends during the holidays ?
[unused1] [unused2] Where do you go and who do you visit ?
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##ve been to your lovely state once before , down in the ho ##llers .
[unused1] [unused2] we go to my niece ' ##s house and
[unused1] [unused2] My kids , uh , kids and their kids come , all but one of them .
[unused1] [unused2] My son goes to his in ##- ##laws , but my two girls will come and
[unused1] [unused2] I have a sister in Ohio , she usually comes in .
[unused1] [unused2] and then when we moved to Alabama there was n ##' ##t a lot of family close by .
[unused1] [unused2] Any ##body can come here Christmas day that wants to .
[unused1] [unused2] - well , my sister usually comes in from Ohio because it ' ##s not that far like - ##- two hundred fifty miles or something , and she ' ##ll come in for Thanksgiving .
[unused1] [unused2] - and she ' ##s going to have to fly back to Wisconsin , um -
[unused1] [unused2] - I went to a place ca - ##- I want to say it was called St ##ump Town ,
[unused1] [unused2] It - they w - had to go up there about some natural gas rights or something like that .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , you had to cross a little walking , swinging bridge to get to this man ' ##s house , you know .
[unused1] [unused2] Where do you go and who do you visit ?
[unused1] [unused2] I think we may have talked before .

[unused1] [unused2] So , pretty much , uh , um , n - m - We , uh , have - we have two adult children that have been married in the last two years , and I ' ##m just wondering just how long it ' ##s going to be that the - - ##- they ' ##re doing the , um , you know , his parents her parents , uh , Christmas trips , but sounds like you ' ##ve been doing that for a while .
[unused1] [unused2] Well my mom and dad are dead .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m fifty ##- ##one , and both of my parents have been dead a while .

[unused1] [unused2] War in Iraq The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fall ##u ##jah , Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] I have - ##- my cousin ' ##s getting ready to go over there and it just , oh , it just makes me sick .
[unused1] [unused2] But my dad was in the army and he was in Vietnam war and he ' ##s like , this is crazy , you know .
[unused1] [unused2] And , um , I mean , I agree with my dad and , you know , if anybody should know it ' ##s someone that fought in a war , you know .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , you he - you hear these people saying that , I mean , that are in the mi ##li - military you - you - ##- that it sa - you - some people who have come back home already and everything that they do n ##' ##t agree with the whole thing .
[unused1] [unused2] And and and to me , to let people die because so your friends
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , I mean , and and here are these military guys giving their lives , and working hard every day through training and stuff even if there is n ##' ##t a war ,
[unused1] [unused2] and you ' ##re paying them piss - ##- because I do n ##' ##t know if you watch the news a lot , but , uh , like , last summer they showed military people standing on lines for , like , getting food and stuff that they do n ##' ##t get paid enough - ##- to where -
[unused1] [unused2] yeah , they ' ##re - where they ' ##re coming home from the war and they - ##- yeah , they ' ##re - they ' ##re pretty much homeless and - and ha - they have nothing .
[unused1] [unused2] You know , you ' ##re sending these guys over there and you want them to be at peace of mind , you know , they - you want them to be able to fight , you know ,
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , and they c - the come home to nothing after g - all they ' ##ve gone through they come home and they have nothing .
[unused1] [unused2] right - ##- a little bit right after the war started in Iraq there was a soldier that spoke out and he got re ##p ##rima ##nded for it .
[unused1] [unused2] uh , spoke out against the war publicly and he got re ##p ##rima ##nded for it
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##re going over there , we ' ##re saying , look , this is how we do it - ##- and , um , i - - ##- so we think everybody else should be that way .
[unused1] [unused2] War in Iraq The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fall ##u ##jah , Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Much of the country is unstable , but national elections are still scheduled to take place in Iraq in January .
[unused1] [unused2] Do you think the elections scheduled for January will take place , and if not , then what ?
[unused1] [unused2] Well , I have a nephew , he just got back from Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] He was in the army and he ' ##s going to probably be going to Afghanistan he told me .
[unused1] [unused2] he did n ##' ##t get his papers where he ' ##s going to be c - - ##- he ' ##s in ups ##tate New York right now but he ' ##s going to - ##- have to probably go back to - to either Iraq or A ##f - Afghanistan .
[unused1] [unused2] I - I did n ##' ##t know they could send them more than once .
[unused1] [unused2] That ' ##s why his father did n ##' ##t want to invade Iraq , because of all these problems they ' ##re having now .
[unused1] [unused2] Look at what happened a couple days ago , they killed , um , like seventy people .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t know why - how he got elected , I mean , there ' ##s a lot of people that did vote .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , but , I mean , you know , I do n ##' ##t see what he ' ##s doing , I mean , look all the people that are leaving his cabinet - ##- and their calling for , um , Run - R ##ums ##feld ' ##s re ##gi ##gna - resignation and , uh , even John McCain , he ' ##s a Republican , he wants him - ##- - ##- he wants R ##ums ##feld to get out of there .
[unused1] [unused2] has resigned ?
[unused1] [unused2] Well , yeah , and and they named another one and he resigned .
[unused1] [unused2] E ##h , he quit , or he resigned .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , it ' ##s all - ##- you know , I I I do n ##' ##t know if we ' ##re doing the right thing because now look at Iran , what are we going to be , uh , and he he ' ##s talking about trying to invade Iran now .
[unused1] [unused2] War in Iraq The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fall ##u ##jah , Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Much of the country is unstable , but national elections are still scheduled to take place in Iraq in January .
[unused1] [unused2] Do you think the elections scheduled for January will take place , and if not , then what ?
[unused1] [unused2] Um , yeah , ok - um , eh , uh , it was talking something about , uh , the war in Iraq , um , I guess , yeah , it ' ##s a good thing - ##- about the elections that are going on .
[unused1] [unused2] I just talked to somebody from ~ LA a couple days ago about that on the - ##- survey line .
[unused1] [unused2] do you think the elections are going to happen ?
[unused1] [unused2] Do you think the elections are going to happen ?
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , I think the - ##- I think they ' ##re still they ' ##re going to go through even though , uh , even though , um , what ' ##s it called , that you know of all the - ##- turmoil that ' ##s happening there and all of the a ##rg ##u - you know , and all the - ##- killings and everything .
[unused1] [unused2] They kept on scheduling them and they we ' ##re saying , oh , no no no , you know .
[unused1] [unused2] Um , yeah , I think - ##- you know I think they should have continued to go through with it , and you know um - ##- if - if there is - ##- if there ' ##s problems , you know , just - ##- still - ##- do n ##' ##t , you know - ##- just ignore it , keep going , you know you ca n ##' ##t - ##- stop , you know , if you already started something , you know , you should complete it , I think .
[unused1] [unused2] And assist them with the elections and they need to complete the elections and all this .
[unused1] [unused2] Do you support the - ##- do you - do you support the war ?
[unused1] [unused2] Do you support the war ?
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , I did at first I just - I just - ##- I - ##- do n ##' ##t like the way it was managed .
[unused1] [unused2] Yeah , I - I mean , I - I did support the war .
[unused1] [unused2] I know they set up the council , uh , interim council , but that has n ##' ##t gone , you know , per ##fe - smoothly .
[unused1] [unused2] So , if they can just sort of make a - ##- be - get into more of a supportive role and , you know , fl ##ex their muscles when they need to and maybe that will help - help , uh , sq ##ual ##l some of the v ##i - the violence .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t know if that could , uh , if that ' ##s a - ##- plausible goal or not because , uh , it ' ##s just that - that - ##- a lot of that ' ##s , you know , uh , weapons and terrorists have been , you know , getting through the borders , probably from Syria .
[unused1] [unused2] The first si ##zable relief convoy arrived in Iraq during a sand ##storm Wednesday as allied forces struggled to clear the way for more aid shipment ##s , using do ##lphin ##s to remove mines from water ##ways and hunting Iraqi fighters around the port of Um ##m Q ##as ##r .
[unused1] [unused2] Three days after U ##. ##S ##. President George W ##. Bush promised ` ##` massive amounts ' ##' of humanitarian aid , seven large , battered tractor ##- ##tra ##iler ##s arrived in Um ##m Q ##as ##r carrying food and water donated by Kuwait ##is .
[unused1] [unused2] The convoy was escorted by U ##. ##S ##. soldiers .
[unused1] [unused2] As the trucks lumber ##ed past blasted buildings on the Iraq ##- ##K ##u ##wai ##t border , an Iraqi boy of about 10 pointed to his mouth and shouted ` ##` Eat , eat ! ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] People lined up along the streets , giving thumbs ##- ##up signs to the aid convoy as it rolled by and begging for food and cigarettes .
[unused1] [unused2] After days of fierce fighting that shut down the city of Um ##m Q ##as ##r , Iraqi youths cheer ##ed and s ##warm ##ed British troops as they handed out yellow meal packets and bottles of water Wednesday .
[unused1] [unused2] Plans to bring supplies to Iraqi civilians had been on hold for days because of fighting across southern Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] White House spokesman Ari F ##le ##ische ##r blamed Saddam Hussein ' ##s regime for slowing the flow of US ##$ 105 million in U ##. ##S ##. aid by placing mines in the port of Um ##m Q ##as ##r .
[unused1] [unused2] The British said they had enough control over the area to begin sending in ships .
[unused1] [unused2] A British ship , the Sir Gala ##had , moved into position at the mouth of the K ##hor Abd ##all ##ah river Tuesday night with 211 tons of food and 101 tons of bottle ##d water .
[unused1] [unused2] It was to begin the six ##- ##hou ##r journey into Um ##m Q ##as ##r on Wednesday , according to a pool report .
[unused1] [unused2] The World Food Program , a U ##. ##N ##. agency , said it would make its biggest single request for cash in its history _ more than US ##$ 1 billion to help feed the war ##- ##st ##rick ##en nation for about six months .
[unused1] [unused2] Before the war , Iraqi ##s depended on government ratio ##ns distributed under the U ##. ##N ##. ' ##s oil ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##food program .
[unused1] [unused2] The war has thrown the future of that program in doubt .
[unused1] [unused2] Because the United States and Britain failed to get U ##. ##N ##. backing for the war , Russia , France , Germany and China want to ensure that the immediate humanitarian costs of the war are paid by the United States _ and not the United Nations .
[unused1] [unused2] A resolution giving him authority to run the program for 45 days is stalled because Russia , Syria and others are insisting the United Nations must not sa ##nc ##tion the war or give the United States control over the U ##. ##N ##. ##- ##con ##tro ##lled account , which holds billion ##s of dollars .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Me ##hdi Sale ##h accused the United States and Britain of causing the hard ##ships by launching the war and disrupt ##ing shipment ##s of supplies under the oil ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##food program .
[unused1] [unused2] Kurdish militia ##men and U ##. ##S ##. special operations troops linked up with more than 1 ##, ##00 ##0 U ##. ##S ##. Army para ##tro ##oper ##s Thursday to secure the area around a strategic air strip , as the first large coalition ground force in northern Iraq began opening another front against Saddam Hussein ' ##s regime .
[unused1] [unused2] The Army ' ##s 173 ##rd Airborne Brigade , including elite Army Rangers , jumped out of low ##- ##fly ##ing C ##- ##17 transport planes under cover of darkness Wednesday and secured a snow ##- ##dust ##ed airfield , which will be used to bring in supplies and support personnel .
[unused1] [unused2] The air ##dr ##op _ one of the biggest para ##tro ##op drops in decades _ was a dramatic entry for ground troops into a region where only small groups of U ##. ##S ##. special forces have been operating .
[unused1] [unused2] Coalition airs ##tri ##kes have been hitting Iraqi military forces and other strategic targets in the north .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` This tighten ##s the no ##ose against Saddam ' ##s forces battling coalition forces to the south , ' ##' B ##rig ##.
[unused1] [unused2] Giving cover for the deployment , U ##. ##S ##. war ##planes struck Iraqi ground troops and bunker ##s in northern Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Three waves of combat planes from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt hit ` ##` ground troops , command and control bunker ##s , artillery positions and ... a surface to air missile battery , ' ##' said Lt ##. John Oliveira , the ship ' ##s public affair officer .
[unused1] [unused2] Around dawn Thursday , strikes resumed , with a massive explosion just outside the Kurdish zone close to the village of Ka ##lak .
[unused1] [unused2] War ##planes pounded forward Iraqi positions in the hills overlooking Cha ##m ##cha ##mal , 35 kilometers - ##LR ##B ##- 22 miles - ##R ##RB ##- east of the key oil city of Kirk ##uk .
[unused1] [unused2] Later Thursday , Kurdish troops in Cha ##m ##cha ##mal advanced their positions between government ##- ##con ##tro ##lled and rebel ##- ##con ##tro ##lled areas , taking over a Iraqi check point on their front with no fighting at this point , witnesses said .
[unused1] [unused2] Early Thursday , Kurdish fighters closed off a highway and roads near the airs ##tri ##p where troops were said to be arriving , outside the town of Ba ##shu ##r , about 30 miles - ##LR ##B ##- 50 kilometers - ##R ##RB ##- northeast of the Ku ##rd ##- ##con ##tro ##lled city of I ##rb ##il and 30 miles - ##LR ##B ##- 50 kilometers - ##R ##RB ##- south of the Turkish border .
[unused1] [unused2] Future air ##lift ##s into the area will include supplies and support personnel for the 173 ##rd ' ##s fighters , defense officials said .
[unused1] [unused2] Lt ##. Col ##. Thomas Collins , a spokesman for the U ##. ##S ##. Army ' ##s Southern European Task Force , refused to say whether the para ##tro ##oper ##s deployed directly from Italy into Iraq or had taken a different route .
[unused1] [unused2] The country ' ##s parliament voted this month to allow U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led coalition forces to use Italian air space and military bases _ but not for directs attacks on Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Pentagon officials have said for weeks they would have U ##. ##S ##. forces in northern Iraq to open another front against Saddam ' ##s forces .
[unused1] [unused2] The vast majority of the coalition ground troops in Iraq are moving toward Baghdad from the south after entering from Kuwait .
[unused1] [unused2] Pentagon officials had hoped to have the Army ' ##s 4th Infantry Division invade Iraq from the north , but Turkey b ##alk ##ed at allowing up to 62 ##, ##00 ##0 U ##. ##S ##. troops on its soil to prepare for that option .
[unused1] [unused2] Though no hostilities were expected during the deployment , the 173 ##rd decided to parachute in rather then ferry troops in by plane so that a significant combat force could mass almost immediately to protect itself , officers said , according to a U ##. ##S ##. reporter traveling with the 173 ##rd .
[unused1] [unused2] Most of the Ad ##nan Division of the Republican Guard relocated from the Mo ##sul area to the T ##ik ##rit area shortly before the war began .
[unused1] [unused2] Turkey has said it may send more troops into northern Iraq to prevent refugees from moving north , while U ##. ##S ##. officials have said they advised Turkey against sending large additional forces into northern Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Former Danish international St ##ig To ##ef ##ting dropped his appeal of an assault conviction and will serve a four ##- ##mont ##h jail sentence , Denmark ' ##s TV ##2 reported Monday .
[unused1] [unused2] To ##ef ##ting was convicted in October 2002 of assault ##ing a pair of restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates in the capital , Copenhagen .
[unused1] [unused2] He was sentenced to four months in prison , but appealed .
[unused1] [unused2] The hearing was scheduled for April 10 .
[unused1] [unused2] TV ##2 , q ##uo ##ting To ##ef ##ting ' ##s lawyer Anders N ##em ##eth , reported that that 33 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately .
[unused1] [unused2] Earlier this month , To ##ef ##ting said English Premier League club Bolton let him go so he could prepare for the appeal .
[unused1] [unused2] It was unclear whether To ##ef ##ting would return to Bolton after serving his sentence .
[unused1] [unused2] The club said it was n ##' ##t aware of To ##ef ##ting ' ##s decision to drop his appeal .
[unused1] [unused2] To ##ef ##ting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club Hamburg .
[unused1] [unused2] To ##ef ##ting has been convicted before .
[unused1] [unused2] In 1999 he was given a 20 ##- ##day suspended sentence for assault ##ing a fan who be ##rated him for playing with German club Du ##is ##burg .
[unused1] [unused2] The popular player _ known for his temper ##ament and the words ` ##` No Reg ##ret ' ##' tattoo ##ed across his chest _ retired from Denmark ' ##s national team after it was knocked out in the second round of the 2002 World Cup .
[unused1] [unused2] To ##ef ##ting joined the Danish squad in 1993 and has 41 caps .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. soldiers moved to capture Baghdad ' ##s Saddam International Airport early Friday and fought running battles with Iraqi defenders along the city ' ##s southern fringe ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] There was fierce fighting in Ku ##t , to the south of Baghdad , where desperate Iraqi ##s armed with rifles charged tanks in a suicide raid .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We m ##owed down ' ##' the attackers , said Lt ##. Col ##. B ##. ##P ##.
[unused1] [unused2] Despite declaration ##s that more tough fighting lies ahead , the top U ##. ##S ##. military official indicated there may not be an all ##- ##out battle for Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Gen ##. Richard Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , suggested is ##ola ##ting members of the old regime in the capital _ cut off from the rest of the country _ while an ` ##` interim administration ' ##' is put in place to begin work on a postwar government .
[unused1] [unused2] A meeting to organize an interim government could be held in Iraq within a week , a senior Pentagon official said Thursday night .
[unused1] [unused2] For the first time in the war , large parts of Baghdad lost electricity .
[unused1] [unused2] Trace ##r rounds lit the night sky and artillery boom ##ed near the airport a few kilometers - ##LR ##B ##- miles - ##R ##RB ##- from the heart of President Saddam Hussein ' ##s capital of 5 million people .
[unused1] [unused2] At one stage , it appeared that U ##. ##S ##. forces had taken control of the airport , ` ##` and then it got more confusing with continued fighting , Myers said Thursday night .
[unused1] [unused2] Capt ##ure of the airport would give American and British troops a facility for air ##lifting equipment and troops to Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Along the city ' ##s southern edge , U ##. ##S ##. tanks and Bradley vehicles destroyed at least seven Iraqi armored personnel carriers and more than 15 Iraqi tanks in fighting that went on for more than four hours .
[unused1] [unused2] Two weeks into the war , American commanders reported a string of successes _ on the battlefield and within an Iraqi population initially reluctant about em ##bracing invading troops .
[unused1] [unused2] Two Marines were killed and one injured in the close ##- ##qua ##rter ##s fighting in Ku ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] And an Army soldier investigating a destroyed tank in central Iraq was killed by friendly fire when he was mistaken for an Iraqi , the military said .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. defense officials also were investigating whether a Navy Horne ##t jet that crashed Wednesday was shot down by a U ##. ##S ##. Patriot missile .
[unused1] [unused2] The overall toll of American troops dead passed 50 , and Bush visited a Marine camp , which has lost 13 _ more than any other installation .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` He ' ##s in heaven , ' ##' the commander in chief told the family of one fallen Marine in a private moment .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Fight them with your hands .
[unused1] [unused2] God will di ##s ##gra ##ce them , ' ##' they said , referring to invading American and British troops .
[unused1] [unused2] As conventional units fought their way to the outskirts of the capital , officials said special forces had raided the T ##hart ##har presidential palace near T ##ik ##rit , Saddam ' ##s hometown .
[unused1] [unused2] To the far north , U ##. ##S ##. special forces and Kurdish militia ##men captured the town of Bar ##dar ##ash and a nearby bridge , one of few routes into the city of Mo ##sul near government ##- ##held oil fields .
[unused1] [unused2] In the country ' ##s southern region , British forces penetrated closer to the center of Ba ##s ##ra , and war ##planes dropped 500 ##- ##po ##und - ##LR ##B ##- 225 ##- ##ki ##log ##ram - ##R ##RB ##- and 1 ##, ##00 ##0 ##- ##po ##und - ##LR ##B ##- 450 ##- ##ki ##log ##ram - ##R ##RB ##- laser ##- ##gu ##ided bombs on an Iraqi intelligence complex .
[unused1] [unused2] American officials cited continuing examples of Iraqi ##s co ##oper ##ating with invading troops .
[unused1] [unused2] In Na ##ja ##f , they said a prominent c ##ler ##ic under house arrest by the Iraqi government had urged the population not to interfere with the operations of American or British forces .
[unused1] [unused2] A small group of Iraqi defenders has been holding out inside the city in a mosque , considered a Shi ##ite holy site , and local c ##ler ##ics said one religious leader had recently arrived in hopes of arranging for their safe passage out of the shrine .
[unused1] [unused2] Ground forces closed in on Baghdad from separate southern approaches , the Army from the southeast and Marines from the southwest , in advances begun Tuesday night .
[unused1] [unused2] American and British helicopters and planes bombed positions in Ku ##t , and Marines and Iraqi ##s lo ##bbed grenades at close quarters .
[unused1] [unused2] Between 10 and 15 Iraqi ##s armed only with rifles charged Marine tanks in the suicide charge .
[unused1] [unused2] Two U ##. ##S ##. Marines died in the fighting _ and a me ##dic who tried to save one of them sorrow ##fully buried his re ##sus ##citation equipment on the spot .
[unused1] [unused2] Army forces rolled past dozens of dead Iraqi soldiers and bombed ##- ##out h ##ul ##ks of Iraqi military equipment as they made their way toward Baghdad from the area around Ka ##rb ##ala .
[unused1] [unused2] At the same time they worried about chemical weapons attacks , Brooks disclosed that a special operations force in the southwestern desert had found a number of bottles ` ##` marked in strange ways . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Russia has accepted a US ##$ 150 million World Bank loan to combat the spread of AIDS and tuberculosis , ending a negotiating process that lasted four years , World Bank officials said Friday .
[unused1] [unused2] The World Bank first offered the loan in 1999 , but disagreements over treatment kept the project on hold .
[unused1] [unused2] But after drawn ##- ##out talks , President Vladimir Putin signed off on the loan , which will take effect this year , the World Bank said .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea on Sunday rejected the U ##. ##N ##. Security Council ' ##s plan to discuss the stand ##off over its suspected nuclear weapons development , calling it ` ##` a pre ##lude to war . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Meanwhile , South Korean officials said Cabinet ##- ##lev ##el talks scheduled this week between the two Korea ##s looked unlikely to take place .
[unused1] [unused2] Seoul had hoped to use the meeting to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its nuclear ambitions .
[unused1] [unused2] The Security Council is scheduled to discuss North Korea ' ##s nuclear program on Wednesday , and P ##yon ##gy ##ang has said that any sanctions imposed on it will be tan ##tam ##ou ##nt to war .
[unused1] [unused2] The Security Council ' ##s ` ##` handling of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula itself is precisely a pre ##lude to war , ' ##' the spokesman said .
[unused1] [unused2] For months , North Korea has insisted on direct talks with the United States to negotiate a non ##ag ##gression treaty .
[unused1] [unused2] But KC ##NA quoted the spokesman as saying that the U ##. ##S ##. invasion of Iraq showed that Washington was not bound by international agreements .
[unused1] [unused2] If the U ##. ##N ##. Security Council cooperate ##s with U ##. ##S ##. efforts to ` ##` s ##ti ##fle ' ##' North Korea , it would leave the North with ` ##` no other option but to beef up the de ##ter ##rent force for war by mob ##ili ##zing all the potential ##s , ' ##' KC ##NA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying .
[unused1] [unused2] For weeks , North Korea has claimed that the United States plans to attack it after Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Seoul had hoped to use the three ##- ##day talks to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its suspected nuclear program in return for aid and better relations with the outside world .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea called off two working ##- ##lev ##el talks with South Korea last month .
[unused1] [unused2] Also on Sunday , South Korean law ##makers said they would work to quickly set up a special parliamentary committee to deal with the North ' ##s nuclear issue .
[unused1] [unused2] American troops stormed a presidential palace and other key buildings in Baghdad as U ##. ##S ##. tanks rumbled into the heart of the battered Iraqi capital on Monday amid the thunder of gunfire and explosions .
[unused1] [unused2] Reporter ##s saw the tanks roll into the heart of Baghdad on the western side of the T ##ig ##ris River , which divides the city .
[unused1] [unused2] As U ##. ##S ##. columns moved northeast along the T ##ig ##ris river , Iraqi ##s fled along its banks and some jumped in the water .
[unused1] [unused2] More than 70 tanks and 60 Bradley armored vehicles were involved in the b ##litz , military sources said .
[unused1] [unused2] At the palace compound , Iraqi ##s shot small arms fire from a clock tower , which the U ##. ##S ##. tanks quickly destroyed .
[unused1] [unused2] Most of the compound was severely damaged from prior U ##. ##S ##. raids .
[unused1] [unused2] Col ##. David Perkins , a brigade commander of the 3rd Infantry , told his troops before the operation that the mission was intended to be ` ##` a dramatic show of force ' ##' to demonstrate that U ##. ##S ##. forces can enter Baghdad at any time , anywhere .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` I hope this makes it clear to the Iraqi people that this - ##LR ##B ##- the regime - ##R ##RB ##- is over and that they can now enjoy their new freedom , ' ##' Perkins said .
[unused1] [unused2] Monday ' ##s in ##cursion by U ##. ##S ##. armor was the second , but appeared to be much heavier .
[unused1] [unused2] The first one was on Saturday and triggered intense gun battles , which according to some U ##. ##S ##. accounts , left at least 2 ##, ##00 ##0 Iraqi fighters dead .
[unused1] [unused2] Since coalition troops seized Baghdad ' ##s international airport , they have en ##ci ##rcle ##d the heavily ##- ##bo ##mbe ##d city of 5 million people , blocking off entry and exits and monitored all movement from the air .
[unused1] [unused2] In a move weighted with symbol ##ism and tactical importance , a h ##ul ##king U ##. ##S ##. C ##- ##13 ##0 transport plane flew into Baghdad ' ##s airport .
[unused1] [unused2] The arrival pre ##sa ##ged a major re ##su ##pp ##ly effort by air for U ##. ##S ##. troops , dependent until now on a ten ##uous line stretching 550 kilometers - ##LR ##B ##- 350 miles - ##R ##RB ##- to Kuwait .
[unused1] [unused2] Monday ' ##s advances came one day after British forces in the south made their deepest push into Iraq ' ##s second largest city .
[unused1] [unused2] Gen ##. Peter Pace , vice chairman of the U ##. ##S ##. Joint Chiefs of Staff , told CNN that U ##. ##S ##. forces drove though portions of the Iraqi capital , se ##izing Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We do control the highways in and out of the city and do have the capability to inter ##dict , to stop , to attack any Iraqi military forces that might try to either escape or to engage our forces , ' ##' said Pace .
[unused1] [unused2] In ##tens ##e fighting over the weekend took a growing toll on combat ##ants and civilians .

[unused1] [unused2] British Desert Rat ##s went into the city of 1 ##. ##3 million with more than three dozen tanks and armored cars , a column similar in size to the American unit that probe ##d suburban Baghdad .

[unused1] [unused2] The United States is deploy ##ing some of Iraq ' ##s exile ##s and internal di ##ssi ##dent ##s around the country to help root out pro ##- ##S ##ad ##dam elements , keep order and distribute aid , according to one such organization , the Iraq National Congress .

[unused1] [unused2] Toyota Motor Corp ##. said Tuesday it will promote A ##ki ##o Toy ##oda , a grandson of the company ' ##s founder who is widely viewed as a candidate to some day head Japan ' ##s largest auto ##maker .
[unused1] [unused2] Managing director Toy ##oda , 46 , grandson of Ki ##ichi ##ro Toy ##oda and the eldest son of Toyota honorary chairman S ##ho ##ichi ##ro Toy ##oda , will become one of 14 senior managing directors under a stream ##lined management system set to be introduced after a shareholders ' meeting in June , the company said in a statement .
[unused1] [unused2] Toy ##oda , who joined Toyota , based in Toyota city , central Japan , in 1984 , spear ##headed the auto ##maker ' ##s Internet and te ##lem ##atic ##s business _ a technology that puts wireless communications into vehicles .
[unused1] [unused2] Ki ##ichi ##ro Toy ##oda founded the auto ##maker in 1937 , transforming the lo ##om manufacturer started by his father into an auto ##maker .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. forces tightened their grip throughout Baghdad , entering the city for the first time from the north , se ##izing a military airport and battling sniper ##s and Republican Guard fighters .
[unused1] [unused2] Meanwhile , the U ##. ##S ##. military faced sharp criticism over assaults that killed three foreign journalists .
[unused1] [unused2] Pentagon officials said Tuesday they did n ##' ##t know whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein died in the U ##. ##S ##. airs ##tri ##ke on a Baghdad neighborhood the day before .
[unused1] [unused2] The strike destroyed three nearby houses and killed at least two people .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. Marines battled sniper ##s as they fought deeper into the capital from the east .
[unused1] [unused2] They seized the Ra ##she ##ed Airport and captured enough ammunition for an estimated 3 ##, ##00 ##0 troops .
[unused1] [unused2] O ##min ##ously , they also took a prison where they found U ##. ##S ##. Army uniforms and chemical weapons suits possibly belonging to American P ##OW ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Some army units routed Iraqi fighters from a Republican Guard headquarters inside the capital .
[unused1] [unused2] Members of the U ##. ##S ##. Army ' ##s V Corps opened up a new front by entering Baghdad from the north .
[unused1] [unused2] The toll on Iraqi civilians four days after Americans first penetrated the Baghdad outskirts is unknown .
[unused1] [unused2] But the World Health Organization said Baghdad ' ##s hospitals were running out of supplies to treat the burns , s ##hra ##p ##nel wounds and spinal injuries caused by the fighting .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi officials , however , remained def ##iant , saying Iraq ' ##s forces would never surrender to American forces : ` ##` They will be burnt , ' ##' said Information Minister Mohammed Sa ##eed al ##- ##S ##ah ##ha ##f .
[unused1] [unused2] In central Baghdad , a Re ##uters camera ##man and a camera ##man for Spain ' ##s Tel ##ec ##in ##co died when an American tank fired on the Palestine Hotel .
[unused1] [unused2] Ta ##re ##q A ##y ##yo ##ub , a journalist with Al ##- ##J ##az ##eera , died when a U ##. ##S ##. war ##plane bombed the Arab ##- ##lang ##ua ##ge satellite television ' ##s office .
[unused1] [unused2] An Abu Dhabi TV office in Baghdad also was hit .
[unused1] [unused2] Al ##- ##J ##az ##eera cat ##ego ##rical ##ly denied that its Baghdad bureau had been used by Iraqi forces to fire on U ##. ##S ##. troops .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. Central Command said it fired on the TV office and the hotel after U ##. ##S ##. forces came under ` ##` significant ' ##' fire from those buildings .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` All the shooting was concentrated on the bridge and across the river , ' ##' where U ##. ##S ##. forces were located , he said .
[unused1] [unused2] It was not clear whether any Iraqi leader had been killed in the airs ##tri ##ke targeting Saddam in an ups ##cale Baghdad neighborhood .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi rescue workers pulled two bodies from the rubble but said the toll could be as high as 14 .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` I do n ##' ##t know whether he survived , ' ##' U ##. ##S President George W ##. Bush said of Saddam at a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
[unused1] [unused2] In northern Iraq , Kurdish forces tightened their ring around Kirk ##uk on Tuesday , following heavy coalition airs ##tri ##kes on Iraqi fronts .
[unused1] [unused2] An A ##- ##10 ` ##` War ##th ##og ' ##' war ##plane was shot down near Baghdad , believed to be the first fixed ##- ##wing aircraft downed by an Iraqi surface ##- ##to ##- ##air missile since the war began .
[unused1] [unused2] Official ##s did not say whether the plane was shot down or crashed accidentally .
[unused1] [unused2] British forces also began establishing the country ' ##s first postwar administration Tuesday , granting a local she ##ik power to set up an administrative committee representing the groups in the region .
[unused1] [unused2] Ambassador Mohammed Al ##- ##D ##our ##i , the first Iraqi official to con ##cede defeat in the U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led war , met privately with Secretary ##- ##G ##ener ##al Ko ##fi Anna ##n , but refused to talk about rumors that he was planning to leave New York .
[unused1] [unused2] This is my last word to you , ' ##' he told ho ##rdes of journalists who chased him Thursday at his New York residence and U ##. ##N ##. headquarters seeking comment on his talks with the secretary ##- ##gene ##ral , his future and the war .
[unused1] [unused2] Anna ##n also declined to comment on Thursday ' ##s meeting with Al ##- ##D ##our ##i .
[unused1] [unused2] Beside meeting with Anna ##n , Al ##- ##D ##our ##i spent several hours during the late morning and afternoon meeting with ambassador ##s and diplomat ##s in the Del ##eg ##ate ' ##s Lounge .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` I wished him good luck but I do n ##' ##t know what he said to the secretary ##- ##gene ##ral and what will be his next steps , ' ##' said Arab League Secretary ##- ##G ##ener ##al Am ##r Mo ##uss ##a , who talked with Al ##- ##D ##our ##i before his own meeting with Anna ##n .
[unused1] [unused2] In an interview with The Associated Press Wednesday night , Al ##- ##D ##our ##i said he will continue to work at the United Nations and had no intention of defect ##ing .
[unused1] [unused2] Anna ##n said early Thursday _ before meeting Al ##- ##D ##our ##i _ that in talks with the en ##voy Monday , ` ##` he did n ##' ##t ask for an asylum or protection ... - ##LR ##B ##- and - ##R ##RB ##- he did n ##' ##t ask me for help with his status . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We did talk about what happens , depending on the evolution of things on the ground , ' ##' Anna ##n said .
[unused1] [unused2] The ambassador had ve ##hem ##ently defended his country for months as the United States and its allies sought U ##. ##N ##. backing for war on Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Al ##- ##D ##our ##i taught international law at Baghdad University for over 30 years before becoming a diplomat in 1999 , first at the United Nations in Geneva and since early 2001 at U ##. ##N ##. headquarters in New York .
[unused1] [unused2] He said in the AP interview he would love to return to teaching but for now he plans to remain at the United Nations .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` What I worried about is that things are settled in the country ... so in the future the Iraqi people will live in peace without sanctions , without wars , without suffering .
[unused1] [unused2] Sep ##arate ##ly , lawyers who claim that Iraq helped plan the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people asked a judge at a federal court in New York to force Al ##- ##D ##our ##i to testify in the case and hold the en ##voy in contempt , saying they worry that he would flee the country .
[unused1] [unused2] Larry K ##lay ##man , chairman of Judicial Watch , which represent 14 survivors and victims ' relatives who have filed a $ 1 ##. ##5 billion federal lawsuit against Iraq in Washington , said his organization had served a sub ##po ##ena on Al ##- ##D ##our ##i twice , on March 26 and March 28 , but said he has not responded .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. District Judge John S ##. Martin did not immediately rule but scheduled a hearing for next week .
[unused1] [unused2] The April 19 , 1995 , bombing of the Alfred P ##. Mu ##rra ##h federal building was the dead ##liest terrorist strike on American soil at the time .
[unused1] [unused2] The suit claims Iraqi officials provided money and training to convicted bomber Timothy M ##c ##V ##ei ##gh and con ##sp ##ira ##tor Terry Nichols .
[unused1] [unused2] M ##c ##V ##ei ##gh was executed in 2001 , and Nichols is serving a life sentence .
[unused1] [unused2] The lawyer of former Zambia ##n president Frederick Chi ##lub ##a was re ##p ##rima ##nded by a Lu ##sa ##ka magistrate when his client failed to appear in court on theft charges Friday .
[unused1] [unused2] Chi ##lub ##a , who is accused of stealing millions of dollars while in office , did not appear at the Lu ##sa ##ka magistrate ##s court as scheduled because he has filed an appeal to have case heard at a higher court .
[unused1] [unused2] Chi ##lub ##a ' ##s lawyer , Chi ##fu ##mu Band ##a , told the court he had advised Chi ##lub ##a not to appear in court Friday , following an agreement with the prosecution that the case be postponed for a month while the appeal is considered .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The matter is before this court and whether an accused person wishes to request for an ad ##jou ##rn ##ment or they wish to be absent for any other reason , such a request must be done here , ' ##' said Ma ##gis ##trate Christopher S ##ha ##ci ##f ##wa .
[unused1] [unused2] Chi ##lub ##a faces 65 counts of theft including that of 15 billion k ##wa ##cha - ##LR ##B ##- US ##$ 3 million - ##R ##RB ##- in cash from the Zambia National Commercial Bank in Lu ##sa ##ka .
[unused1] [unused2] Chi ##lub ##a was Zambia ' ##s first democratic ##ally elected president .
[unused1] [unused2] He came to office in 1991 and served two five ##- ##ye ##ar terms .
[unused1] [unused2] The dictator Su ##hart ##o has fallen , the constitution has changed , the media was un ##sha ##ckle ##d , democratic elections held , and East Timor freed .
[unused1] [unused2] After Sept ##. 11 , 2001 , Indonesia was quick to sign onto U ##. ##S ##. President George W ##. Bush ' ##s global war on terror .
[unused1] [unused2] Yet , Washington maintains a 12 ##- ##ye ##ar ban on arms sales to the world ' ##s most populous Muslim nation with the aim of curb ##ing human rights abuses still happening despite moment ##ous political change .
[unused1] [unused2] Later this month Indonesian President Mega ##wati Su ##kar ##no ##put ##ri travels to Moscow to seek the K ##rem ##lin ' ##s help in modern ##izing her increasingly obsolete 300 ##, ##00 ##0 ##- ##me ##mber armed forces .
[unused1] [unused2] And , currently , both have opposed the U ##. ##S ##. - led war on Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] Indonesia ' ##s Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natal ##eg ##awa says Mega ##wati ' ##s meeting with Russian President Putin slated for April 21 will touch on the Iraq crisis .
[unused1] [unused2] But other diplomat ##s say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom ##- ##line issues such as trade and arms sales .
[unused1] [unused2] Last year ' ##s Bali bombings , which killed 202 people , illustrated the threat of terrorism in Indonesia .
[unused1] [unused2] And , broad opposition to the U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a back ##lash by militant Islam ##ists .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completely unnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U ##. ##S ##. policies , ' ##' said Ju ##su ##f Wan ##adi of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta .
[unused1] [unused2] Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s under Mega ##wati ' ##s father and founding President Su ##kar ##no , but these were severed after the anti ##- ##com ##mu ##nist Gen ##. Su ##hart ##o seized power in 1965 .
[unused1] [unused2] The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country ' ##s main weapons supplier , and annual arms sales peaked at US ##$ 400 million in the 1980s .
[unused1] [unused2] In 1991 , however , the U ##. ##S ##. Congress banned this after Indonesian troops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor .
[unused1] [unused2] In 1999 , East Timor became free , but only after Indonesian forces laid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro ##- ##ind ##ep ##end ##ence referendum .
[unused1] [unused2] The shocking level of destruction prompted U ##. ##S ##. law ##makers to expand the ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia .
[unused1] [unused2] Since then some in the Bush administration _ particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolf ##ow ##itz , a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war _ have pushed for the ban to be repealed .
[unused1] [unused2] Jakarta has recently purchased some Russian weapons , including 10 ##, ##00 ##0 Ka ##lash ##nikov assault rifles , a squadron of naval Mi ##l ##- ##2 helicopters and a dozen BT ##R ##- ##80 ##A amphibious carriers for its marine ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Currently , Indonesia uses short ##- ##rang ##e Rap ##ier missiles purchased 30 years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in Sumatra , Borneo and Papua from air attack .
[unused1] [unused2] The Air Force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadrons of Su ##kh ##oi Su ##- ##27 intercept ##ors , considered the world ' ##s premier dog ##fighter ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] A U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##sp ##ons ##ored forum that brought Iraqi opposition leaders together to shape the country ' ##s postwar government began Tuesday with a U ##. ##S ##. promise not to rule Iraq and concluded with an agreement to meet again in 10 days .
[unused1] [unused2] Meeting in the biblical birthplace of the prophet Abraham , delegates from Iraq ' ##s many factions discussed the role of religion in the future government and ways to rebuild the country .
[unused1] [unused2] But some Shi ##ite Muslim groups boycott ##ed the meeting and thousands protested nearby .
[unused1] [unused2] It also called for di ##sso ##lving Saddam ' ##s Ba ##ath Party but left open the question of separating church from the state .
[unused1] [unused2] Retired Lt ##. Gen ##. Jay Garner , who will head the U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led interim administration in Iraq , opened the conference under a golden ##- ##color ##ed tent in the shadows of the 4 ##, ##00 ##0 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old z ##ig ##gu ##rat at U ##r , a terrace ##d temple platform of the ancient Su ##mer ##ians .
[unused1] [unused2] Many Iraqi ##s boycott ##ed the meeting in opposition to U ##. ##S ##. plans to install Garner atop an interim administration .
[unused1] [unused2] Thousands of Shi ##ites _ who constitute Iraq ' ##s most populous religious group but were re ##pressed under Saddam Hussein _ demonstrated in nearby Na ##sir ##iya ##h , chanting ` ##` No to America and no to Saddam ! ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. officials hope more Iraqi ##s join the process and stressed that this was just the first of many such meetings in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] The meeting concluded with the delegates voting by show of hands to meet again in 10 days .
[unused1] [unused2] A national conference is planned to select the interim administration , perhaps within weeks , a senior U ##. ##S ##. official said on condition of an ##ony ##mity .
[unused1] [unused2] The interim administration could begin handing power back to Iraqi officials within three to six months , but forming a government will take longer , said Maj ##. Gen ##. Tim Cross , the top British member of Garner ' ##s team .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` One has to go through the process of building from the bottom up , allowing the leadership to establish itself , and then the election process to go through and so forth , ' ##' Cross said .
[unused1] [unused2] Garner ' ##s Office of Reconstruction and Human ##itarian Assistance is charged with coordinating humanitarian assistance , rebuilding infrastructure shattered by years of war and U ##. ##N ##. sanctions , and gradually handing back power to Iraqi ##s leading a democratic ##ally elected government .
[unused1] [unused2] Tuesday ' ##s meeting was the first step toward that goal after the ou ##ster of Saddam .
[unused1] [unused2] She ##ik A ##ya ##d Jamal Al Din , a Shi ##ite religious leader from Na ##sir ##iya ##h , urged the delegates to craft a secular government , according to a pool report .
[unused1] [unused2] He asked coalition representatives to address problems of security , electricity and water in Iraq and help rebuild destroyed and lo ##oted hospitals .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi opposition leaders fear the United States is trying to force Ahmed Cha ##la ##bi , head of the London ##- ##base ##d umbrella Iraqi National Congress , on them as leader of a new Iraqi administration .
[unused1] [unused2] Cha ##la ##bi was the first top Iraqi opposition leader to be air ##lift ##ed by the U ##. ##S ##. military into southern Iraq as the fighting wound down , and he and other top members of his group plan to meet soon in Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. officials said Cha ##la ##bi was brought in because he offered forces to the coalition .
[unused1] [unused2] Neither Cha ##la ##bi nor many other leaders of anti ##- ##S ##ad ##dam groups attended Tuesday ' ##s meeting , but they sent delegates .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi ##s protesting the conference said it did not represent their interests .
[unused1] [unused2] The protesters held banner ##s written in English and Arabic saying the ` ##` Ha ##w ##za , ' ##' or the Shi ##ite religious seminary in Na ##ja ##f , represents them .
[unused1] [unused2] Even some of those at the meeting said they did not want Garner leading the interim administration .
[unused1] [unused2] The lawyer for a Russian military journalist convicted of treason filed an appeal Wednesday in an effort to over ##turn the guilty verdict against his client , who was released on parole earlier this year , news agencies reported .
[unused1] [unused2] G ##rig ##ory Pa ##sko ' ##s lawyer Gen ##ri Re ##z ##nik filed the appeal with Russian Supreme Court , the Inter ##fa ##x and IT ##AR ##- ##T ##ass news agencies reported .
[unused1] [unused2] He asked the court to invalid ##ate the verdict and throw out the criminal case against Pa ##sko , they said .
[unused1] [unused2] Pa ##sko was sentenced to four years in prison in December 2001 for illegally attending a meeting of top military commanders and taking notes there .
[unused1] [unused2] Pa ##sko , whose sentence included time served , was released in January for good behavior after serving more than two ##- ##thi ##rds of the sentence .
[unused1] [unused2] Re ##z ##nik said an initial appeal he lodged the day Pa ##sko was freed never reached the pre ##si ##dium of the Supreme Court , according to Inter ##fa ##x .
[unused1] [unused2] The lawyer said the court ' ##s military board had refused to launch proceedings on the appeal .
[unused1] [unused2] Re ##z ##nik said he addressed the new appeal directly to Supreme Court Chairman V ##ya ##ches ##lav Le ##bed ##ev and asked that it not be considered by military judges ` ##` because the military justice system has adopted a bias ##ed attitude against Pa ##sko , ' ##' Inter ##fa ##x reported .
[unused1] [unused2] American command ##os captured a half brother of Saddam Hussein on Thursday , the latest success in a campaign to round up inside ##rs from the former regime .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. troops th ##wart ##ed a Baghdad bank robbery over the protests of Iraqi ##s eager to share in the lo ##ot .
[unused1] [unused2] With the fighting all but over , the USS Con ##ste ##lla ##tion steamed from the Persian Gulf for its home port , carrying dozens of war ##planes no longer needed .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` I do n ##' ##t think we ' ##ll discover anything , myself , ' ##' R ##ums ##feld said at a meeting with Pentagon employees .
[unused1] [unused2] Eli ##mina ##ting such weapons was a chief reason President George W ##. Bush gave for the U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led invasion of Iraq that began March 20 .
[unused1] [unused2] A U ##. ##S ##. intelligence official , speaking on condition of an ##ony ##mity , said Bar ##zan Ibrahim had been a presidential adviser to Saddam ' ##s regime since 1998 , but had a shaky relationship with his half brother and was not part of the regime ' ##s inner circle .
[unused1] [unused2] He was a representative to the United Nations in Geneva from 1989 to 1998 .
[unused1] [unused2] Earlier , from 1979 to 1983 , he headed Iraq ' ##s Mu ##kha ##bara ##t , or intelligence service , a period when the organization arranged executions of regime opponents in Iraq and overseas , the official said .
[unused1] [unused2] As word spread that the robbery was under way , Iraqi ##s gathered , saying they had accounts at the branch , and a riot broke out .
[unused1] [unused2] Marines broke it up _ over the protests of Iraqi ##s not involved in the robbery _ and the thieves were arrested .
[unused1] [unused2] Gen ##. Tommy Franks , the commander of Operation Iraqi Freedom , told reporters during a visit to Kuwait that ` ##` the lo ##oting goes down every day and I think you will continue to see it go down because the Iraqi ##s are now stepping up and controlling the problems for themselves . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Still , more than a week after the regime collapsed , Marine Staff Sgt ##.
[unused1] [unused2] Americans sought to bring calm to Mo ##sul , where U ##. ##S ##. troops killed 17 people in clashes earlier in the week .
[unused1] [unused2] Brooks , brief ##ing reporters at the U ##. ##S ##. Central Command headquarters , also disclosed that Marines had broken up violent clashes on Wednesday in T ##ik ##rit , Saddam ' ##s hometown .
[unused1] [unused2] The fighting broke out between club ##- ##wi ##eld ##ing members of the former ruler ' ##s clan and a rival group , he said .
[unused1] [unused2] International experts , app ##alle ##d at the lo ##oting of Iraqi historical artifacts , met in Paris under U ##. ##N ##. auspices and called for a temporary em ##bar ##go on Iraqi cultural objects .
[unused1] [unused2] Some of the participants at the meeting said it appeared the lo ##oting was organized , and some of those involved had keys to museum vault ##s and were able to remove items from safe ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Malaysia ' ##s second highest court on Friday rejected an appeal by jailed former Deputy Prime Minister An ##war Ibrahim against his conviction and nine ##- ##ye ##ar prison sentence for so ##dom ##y .
[unused1] [unused2] A three ##- ##ju ##dge panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a verdict by High Court Judge Ari ##fin J ##aka nearly three years ago that found An ##war guilty of so ##dom ##izing his wife ' ##s former driver .
[unused1] [unused2] An ##war is expected to appeal again with the Federal Court , Malaysia ' ##s highest court .
[unused1] [unused2] Speaking to reporters after the verdict , An ##war la ##mba ##sted the judges , saying they had been ` ##` pre ##sel ##ec ##ted ' ##' by the government to q ##ua ##sh his appeal .
[unused1] [unused2] But An ##war ' ##s lawyers said they were filing a fresh request for bail pending a further appeal .
[unused1] [unused2] On Monday , An ##war completed his sentence for a separate conviction on corruption charges , after the six ##- ##ye ##ar sentence was reduced by one ##- ##thi ##rd for good behavior .
[unused1] [unused2] He then began serving the nine ##- ##ye ##ar prison sentence for so ##dom ##y , his lawyers said .
[unused1] [unused2] Prime Minister Ma ##hat ##hir Mo ##ham ##ad fired An ##war , his former pro ##te ##ge , in 1998 following disputes over financial policy .
[unused1] [unused2] An ##war led large protests against Ma ##hat ##hir before he was arrested , charged and convicted on corruption and so ##dom ##y charges .
[unused1] [unused2] The court also dismissed a joint appeal by An ##war ' ##s adopted brother , Su ##k ##ma Dar ##ma ##wan , who was convicted together with An ##war for so ##dom ##y in August 2000 and sentenced to six years in jail and whipping .
[unused1] [unused2] Su ##k ##ma has been free on bail pending appeal , but the judges on Friday ordered him to begin his sentence .
[unused1] [unused2] S ##ha ##qui ##lle O ##' ##N ##eal ' ##s wife gave birth to a baby boy early Saturday , eliminating any chance that the Los Angeles Lakers center might skip a playoff game to witness the birth .
[unused1] [unused2] Shaun ##ie O ##' ##N ##eal gave birth to the couple ' ##s third child at 1 ##: ##5 ##2 a ##. ##m ##. at a Los Angeles ##- ##are ##a hospital , team spokesman John Black said .
[unused1] [unused2] He was scheduled to fly on his own to Minneapolis late Saturday for Sunday ' ##s opening game of a first ##- ##rou ##nd playoff series against the Minnesota Tim ##ber ##wo ##lves .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We ' ##re really happy for the delivery of a child and the fact that everything ' ##s safe and sound and we can go forward from there , ' ##' coach Phil Jackson said .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Hopefully he can get to Minneapolis , get some rest and be ready to play the first game .
[unused1] [unused2] O ##' ##N ##eal had said he could not rule out missing a game to witness the birth .
[unused1] [unused2] Team ##mate Kobe Bryant said he would not be surprised if O ##' ##N ##eal had a big game Sunday despite his expected late arrival in Minneapolis .
[unused1] [unused2] The birth comes days after the death of O ##' ##N ##eal ' ##s maternal grandfather , Sir ##les ##ter O ##' ##N ##eal .
[unused1] [unused2] The surprise move by France , which led opposition to the U ##. ##S ##. war against Iraq , followed last week ' ##s call by U ##. ##S ##. President George W ##. Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly , so Iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction .
[unused1] [unused2] France ' ##s U ##. ##N ##. ambassador , Jean ##- ##M ##ar ##c de La Sa ##b ##lier ##e , made the proposal at a Security Council meeting where members heard a brief ##ing by chief U ##. ##N ##. weapons inspector Hans B ##lix and for the first time exchanged views on potentially di ##vis ##ive postwar issues .
[unused1] [unused2] The Security Council imposed sanctions after Iraq ' ##s 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
[unused1] [unused2] Along with France , Russia , Germany and China also strongly opposed the war .
[unused1] [unused2] But de La Sa ##b ##lier ##e said before the meeting that Security Council ` ##` must take into account the new realities on the ground . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] At another closed ##- ##do ##or council meeting later Tuesday , the council was to hear from Ben ##on Se ##van , head of the U ##. ##N ##. oil ##- ##fo ##r ##- ##food program , which had been providing food for 60 percent of Iraq ' ##s 24 million people .
[unused1] [unused2] This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the weeks ahead on di ##vis ##ive issues stem ##ming from the war against Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] These include not only Iraq ' ##s di ##sar ##ma ##ment and the future of sanctions but the U ##. ##N ##. role in Iraq now that the fighting is over , control of Iraq ' ##s oil revenue , and lucrative reconstruction contracts .
[unused1] [unused2] The Bush administration , which accused B ##lix of hind ##ering its drive for international support for the war , has already sent its own teams to Iraq to search for illegal weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##N ##. inspector ##s went back to Iraq for the first time in four years in late November and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3 - ##LC ##B ##- months of searching .
[unused1] [unused2] Secretary ##- ##G ##ener ##al Ko ##fi Anna ##n ordered all U ##. ##N ##. international staff , including the inspector ##s , to leave Iraq just before the war began on March 20 .
[unused1] [unused2] She made the statements after a meeting with the speaker of the Portuguese parliament , Jo ##ao Mo ##ta Amar ##al .
[unused1] [unused2] Jones met with Defense Minister Paulo Port ##as on Tuesday and will meet Foreign Minister Antonio Martins da Cruz before leaving Portugal Wednesday .
[unused1] [unused2] Many are hoping to re ##ap benefits from Portuguese government support of the U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led war to ou ##st Saddam Hussein .
[unused1] [unused2] Also , Portugal hosted a last ditch pre ##- ##war summit in the A ##zor ##es islands for leaders of the United States , Britain and Spain .
[unused1] [unused2] Nine scan ##ners , developed locally for military purposes , were placed at Singapore ' ##s Chang ##i Airport last week to check people arriving from SA ##RS ##- ##af ##fected countries .
[unused1] [unused2] Each day about 90 ##, ##00 ##0 people cross the border between Malaysia and Singapore .
[unused1] [unused2] Any person found to be entering Singapore with a high temperature would be directed to a nearby nurse station for further checks .
[unused1] [unused2] Singapore has reported 16 deaths , the world ' ##s third ##- ##hi ##gh ##est toll , out of 186 infected from the flu ##- ##like illness .
[unused1] [unused2] Global ##ly , at least 236 people have died and more than 4 ##, ##00 ##0 have become sick ##ened with the illness .
[unused1] [unused2] Immigration and Check ##points Authority spoke ##s ##woman Ng ##oon P ##ei Ling said during the trial period the scan ##ners would be placed at bus check ##points , where passengers are already required to di ##se ##mba ##rk for immigration purposes .
[unused1] [unused2] Talk ##s between North Korea , the United States and China ended Thursday with U ##. ##S ##. State Department officials saying it was uncertain whether discussions on P ##yon ##gy ##ang ' ##s nuclear program would continue .
[unused1] [unused2] Although North Korea accused the United States of leading the region toward war in its state media , U ##. ##S ##. officials denied reports the talks had broken down .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea also hinted during the meetings that they have nuclear weapons and may conduct a test , a U ##. ##S ##. official said .
[unused1] [unused2] Earlier , Secretary of State Colin Powell had told a gathering of experts from the Asia ##- ##P ##ac ##ific region that the talks had concluded , leaving the impression there would not be a third day of discussions on Friday .
[unused1] [unused2] Powell also expressed hope that South Korea and Japan will be able to participate ` ##` when and if ' ##' there is another round of talks .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` North Korea should not leave the meetings having the slightest impression that they might force us to make a concession we would not otherwise make , ' ##' he added .
[unused1] [unused2] They said reports of a breakdown in the talks were a ` ##` mi ##s ##re ##p ##res ##entation . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] A U ##. ##S ##. official said the North Koreans implied during the talks that they have nuclear weapons and that they may conduct a test .
[unused1] [unused2] In Beijing , chief U ##. ##S ##. ne ##got ##iator , Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly , declined to answer questions , saying only the sides ` ##` had talks . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Ji ##an ##cha ##o refused to provide details , but said the talks were ` ##` con ##du ##ci ##ve to mutual understanding and finding ways to resolve the North Korean nuclear question peacefully . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Disc ##uss ##ions were scheduled to end Friday , when Kelly was to fly to Seoul the same day to meet with South Korean officials .
[unused1] [unused2] The talks are the first high ##- ##lev ##el U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##N ##ort ##h Korean contact since tensions over the North ' ##s nuclear program spike ##d six months ago over Washington ' ##s claim that the North said in October it was trying to develop nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 pledge .
[unused1] [unused2] The North re ##tal ##iated by withdrawing from the nuclear Non ##- ##P ##rol ##ifer ##ation Treaty , ex ##pelling U ##. ##N ##. inspector ##s and restart ##ing a p ##lut ##onium ##- ##p ##rod ##uc ##ing reactor .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea , which is seeking a guarantee from the United States that it w ##o n ##' ##t be attacked , rat ##chet ##ed up the threat of conflict in a statement issued by its official Korean Central News Agency accusing Washington of es ##cal ##ating tensions .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The situation on the Korean Peninsula is so tense that a war may break out any moment due to the U ##. ##S ##. moves , ' ##' the KC ##NA statement said .
[unused1] [unused2] KC ##NA said the war in Iraq had shown the only way for a country to protect itself was to have a strong military de ##ter ##rent .
[unused1] [unused2] Official ##s from Seoul and Washington say the swift U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led victory in Iraq prompted North Korea to agree to the nuclear talks .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea said the ` ##` master key ' ##' for successful talks was for the United States to drop its hostile policy toward P ##yon ##gy ##ang .
[unused1] [unused2] In a likely reference to North Korea ' ##s demand for a non ##ag ##gression treaty with Washington , KC ##NA said : ` ##` The U ##. ##S ##. should settle the talks from a sincere stand and s ##tri ##ve to settle the essential issue . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] The North also likely wants aid for its economy , which has been c ##rippled by the loss of Soviet subsidies and years of drought and mi ##sman ##age ##ment .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea and China fought against the United States in the 1950 ##- ##53 Korean War , which ended without a peace treaty .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea and Washington have no formal relations and are still technically at war .
[unused1] [unused2] China , the North ' ##s ally and major aid donor , says it does n ##' ##t want P ##yon ##gy ##ang to acquire nuclear weapons and has appealed for a negotiated settlement to the crisis .
[unused1] [unused2] A U ##. ##S ##. official praised the Chinese contribution to the discussions .
[unused1] [unused2] R ##i Gun , deputy director of American affairs for North Korea ' ##s Foreign Ministry is representing North Korea at the talks .
[unused1] [unused2] Rudolph G ##iu ##lian ##i will wed his companion , Judith Nathan , on May 24 in the ex ##- ##ma ##yo ##r ' ##s old home , Gracie Mansion .
[unused1] [unused2] His successor , Mayor Michael Bloomberg , will perform the ceremony .
[unused1] [unused2] G ##iu ##lian ##i , 58 , proposed to Nathan , a former nurse , during a November business trip to Paris _ five months after he finalized his divorce from Donna Hanover after 20 years of marriage .
[unused1] [unused2] In interviews last year , G ##iu ##lian ##i said Nathan gave him ` ##` tremendous emotional support ' ##' through his treatment for pro ##state cancer and as he led the city during the aftermath of the Sept ##. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center .
[unused1] [unused2] During the legal proceedings leading up to the divorce , a judge ruled that Nathan could not visit Gracie Mansion , the official mayor ##al residence , as long as G ##iu ##lian ##i ' ##s children lived there .
[unused1] [unused2] The divorce settlement called for G ##iu ##lian ##i to pay Hanover more than $ 6 ##. ##8 million .
[unused1] [unused2] Last month , she and her fi ##ance _ an old high school sweetheart _ invited the press along as they went shopping for wedding bands , saying they are planning a wedding in the New York City area this summer .
[unused1] [unused2] G ##iu ##lian ##i ' ##s first marriage to his second cousin , Regina Peru ##gg ##i , lasted about 14 years .
[unused1] [unused2] It was an ##nu ##lled by the Catholic Church because the couple had not obtained a church di ##sp ##ens ##ation required when second cousins marry .
[unused1] [unused2] Nathan divorced wall ##paper salesman Bruce Nathan in 1992 .
[unused1] [unused2] The G ##iu ##lian ##i ##- ##N ##ath ##an n ##up ##tial ##s will be a first for Bloomberg , who is making an exception from his policy of not performing weddings , said Bloomberg spokesman Ed Sky ##ler .
[unused1] [unused2] G ##iu ##lian ##i regularly off ##ici ##ated at weddings while in office .
[unused1] [unused2] An accident on a diesel ##- ##powered Chinese submarine has killed all 70 officers and sailors aboard , the official Xi ##nh ##ua News Agency reported Friday .
[unused1] [unused2] The submarine was on an exercise when the accident occurred , and ` ##` because of a mechanical ma ##lf ##un ##ction , the 70 crew members on board died , ' ##' the Xi ##nh ##ua report said .
[unused1] [unused2] It did not give further details or say how the crew died .
[unused1] [unused2] The vessel already has been towed back to an unidentified port , Xi ##nh ##ua said .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` There have been rumors going around about the loss of submarines , but this is the first fatal accident that I know of , ' ##' said Cole .
[unused1] [unused2] Foreign military analysts said it would be highly unusual for an accident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allowing the vessel to be recovered .
[unused1] [unused2] M ##c ##G ##int ##y said that the submarine ' ##s batteries might have leaked acid that mixed with sea ##water , creating toxic ch ##lor ##ine gas that killed the crew .
[unused1] [unused2] The torpedoes might have leaked prop ##ella ##nt that poisoned the crew , he said .
[unused1] [unused2] Cole said the loss of all hands suggested the vessel was flooded or sank because of a collision or engineering problem .
[unused1] [unused2] In a conflict over Taiwan or some other confrontation , he said , ` ##` China ' ##s ability to field a force of even a dozen submarines could pose a big problem for any other naval force . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Six European countries have agreed to contribute troops to the British and Polish sectors to create an international stability force , the official said .
[unused1] [unused2] The draft resolution would limit the U ##. ##N ##. role to helping with refugees and displaced people , reconstruction and humanitarian assistance , the official said .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##N ##. Secretary General Ko ##fi Anna ##n said this week that the body has no interest in policing a postwar Iraq , although it could contribute to the political re ##sus ##citation of the country .
[unused1] [unused2] The proposed draft resolution would probably face resistance from other U ##. ##N ##. Security Council members who have favored a U ##. ##N ##. ##- ##con ##ven ##ed conference of the kind that helped establish Afghanistan ' ##s post ##- ##T ##ali ##ban government .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. Defense Secretary Donald H ##. R ##ums ##feld discussed the resolution with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Defense Secretary Geoff Ho ##on on Friday as R ##ums ##feld returned from a tour of Iraq , Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf region .
[unused1] [unused2] International stability forces will be sent to Iraq as soon as possible , the U ##. ##S ##. official said , though it was unclear when that would be .
[unused1] [unused2] Representatives of those countries will meet with British officials May 7 and Polish officials May 22 to determine what forces each country will contribute and whether they will be put under British or Polish command .
[unused1] [unused2] Planning for both the U ##. ##N ##. resolution and the international security force left out France , Germany and Russia , three U ##. ##S ##. allies that ve ##hem ##ently opposed the war in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] The outlines for the international stability force were decided at a conference Ho ##on hosted Wednesday with representatives from 16 countries , mostly NATO members .
[unused1] [unused2] Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council have offered to donate money for the effort .
[unused1] [unused2] R ##ums ##feld also met Friday with King Abdullah of Jordan , an American ally in the Middle East .
[unused1] [unused2] Defense officials say Jordan provided key help in the Iraq war , acting as a staging area for U ##. ##S ##. special operations raids into western Iraq to prevent missiles from being fired at Jordan or Israel .
[unused1] [unused2] Police intercepted 33 African immigrants who came ashore Thursday in southern Spain aboard an over ##crow ##ded boat , including several pregnant women and other travelers suffering from h ##y ##pot ##her ##mia , police said .
[unused1] [unused2] Police also arrested two Moroccan men suspected of trafficking in human beings and na ##vi ##gating the Z ##od ##iac boat across from Africa , E ##fe said .
[unused1] [unused2] Red Cross officials administered first aid on the scene , and the de ##tain ##ees were taken to a processing center for the government to begin expulsion proceedings .
[unused1] [unused2] Ten ##s of thousands of des ##ti ##tu ##te Africans try to enter Spain illegally each year by crossing the per ##ilo ##us Strait of Gibraltar to reach the southern mainland or by sailing northwest to the Canary Islands out in the Atlantic .
[unused1] [unused2] Most are caught trying to sneak in and some die in the attempt .
[unused1] [unused2] A state security court suspended a newspaper critical of the government Saturday after convict ##ing it of publishing religious ##ly inflammatory material , the newspaper ' ##s lawyer said .
[unused1] [unused2] The K ##hart ##ou ##m Monitor may not appear for two months and must pay a fine of 1 million Sudan ##ese pounds - ##LR ##B ##- about US ##$ 400 - ##R ##RB ##- , lawyer Ng ##or O ##lang Ng ##or told The Associated Press .
[unused1] [unused2] F ##ail ##ure to pay the fine would result in a two ##- ##mont ##h extension of the suspension .
[unused1] [unused2] The sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against the Monitor , the only English language daily in Sudan and a leading critic of conditions in the south of the country , where a civil war has been wage ##d for 20 years .
[unused1] [unused2] Ng ##or said the paper would pay the fine but it would also appeal the verdict .
[unused1] [unused2] The court ruling stated that the verdict and sentence would be submitted to the National Press Council , a government ##- ##ap ##point ##ed body , for approval , Ng ##or said .
[unused1] [unused2] The court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the Press Law , which prohibit ##s the publication of material that def ##ame ##s religion or in ##cite ##s religious ##ly unacceptable activity .
[unused1] [unused2] The charges arose from letters ##- ##to ##- ##the ##- ##ed ##itor published last month that dealt with religion .
[unused1] [unused2] Earlier this week , security police detained the Monitor ' ##s managing editor , N ##hia ##l Bo ##l , for 24 hours .
[unused1] [unused2] On his release , he was charged with in ##cite ##ment of public disco ##rd for publishing the letters .
[unused1] [unused2] In a separate action against the Monitor , security officials went to its editorial offices on Thursday night and told the management that it was being closed until it paid a fine of 15 million Sudan ##ese pounds - ##LR ##B ##- about US ##$ 6 ##, ##00 ##0 - ##R ##RB ##- that was outstanding from a court conviction last year .
[unused1] [unused2] In last year ' ##s trial , the paper was convicted of def ##ami ##ng the government for publishing that trains running to and from southern Sudan were used to transport abducted women and children .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea ' ##s military may have fired a laser at a U ##. ##S ##. helicopter in March , a U ##. ##S ##. official said Tuesday , as the communist state ditch ##ed its last legal obligation to keep itself free of nuclear weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] No one was injured and no equipment was damaged in the incident .
[unused1] [unused2] The announcement came as U ##. ##S ##. President George W ##. Bush and South Korean President R ##oh Mo ##o ##- ##hy ##un were about to meet Wednesday in Washington to discuss North Korea ' ##s nuclear programs .
[unused1] [unused2] A U ##. ##S ##. military official in Seoul , speaking on condition of an ##ony ##mity , said Tuesday North Korea is believed to have exported US ##$ 580 million worth of missiles to Iran , Pakistan , Libya , Syria , Egypt , Yemen and the United Arab Emirates in 2001 .
[unused1] [unused2] In December , a shipment of North Korean missiles bound for Yemen was briefly stopped in the Arabian Sea .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea a ##cc ##uses the United States of planning to attack the communist country , which Bush has branded part of an ` ##` axis of evil ' ##' along with Iran and Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] It said the U ##. ##S ##. invasion of Iraq taught it that ` ##` a war can be a ##verted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has ... a strong military de ##ter ##rent force capable of decisive ##ly re ##pelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] During the talks in Beijing , U ##. ##S ##. officials said North Korea claimed it already possesses nuclear weapons , and that it had re ##p ##ro ##cess ##ed 8 ##, ##00 ##0 spent nuclear fuel rods _ a move that could yield several atomic bombs within months .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea offered to drop its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for security guarantees and economic aid , according to U ##. ##S ##. officials .
[unused1] [unused2] A suicide bomber de ##ton ##ated explosives at the entrance to a crowded mall in northern Israel on Monday , killing at least four shop ##pers and wound ##ing 20 in the fifth such attack in two days .
[unused1] [unused2] The spat ##e of bombings under ##sco ##red how difficult it will be to carry out the U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##back ##ed ` ##` road map ' ##' plan , a three ##- ##sta ##ge prescription for ending violence immediately and setting up a Palestinian state by 2005 .
[unused1] [unused2] There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday ' ##s attack at the S ##ha ##are ##i Am ##aki ##m mall in the working class town of A ##ful ##a , which has been targeted repeatedly by Palestinian militants because of its proximity to the West Bank .
[unused1] [unused2] The Islamic militant group Hamas carried out four bombings over the weekend .
[unused1] [unused2] The A ##ful ##a explosion _ the 95 ##th in 32 months of fighting _ went off at 5 ##: ##14 p ##. ##m ##. - ##LR ##B ##- 141 ##4 g ##m ##t - ##R ##RB ##- at the entrance to the mall , reportedly as shop ##pers were waiting in line for a security check .
[unused1] [unused2] Mall ##s and other public places have significantly stepped up security since the outbreak of Israeli ##- ##P ##ales ##tin ##ian fighting in September 2000 .
[unused1] [unused2] The explosion killed the attacker and four shop ##pers , police said .
[unused1] [unused2] Twenty people were wounded , including several who were in serious condition .
[unused1] [unused2] Earlier Monday , a 19 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Palestinian riding a bicycle de ##ton ##ated a 30 ##- ##ki ##lo - ##LR ##B ##- 66 ##- ##po ##und - ##R ##RB ##- bomb near a military j ##eep in the Gaza Strip , injuring three soldiers .
[unused1] [unused2] In response the spat ##e of bombings , Israel threatened to boycott foreign en ##voy ##s who meet with Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] Israel holds the Palestinian leader responsible for the latest violence , even though the recent attacks were carried out by Islamic militants .
[unused1] [unused2] Hamas said Monday it has no intention of halt ##ing attacks , despite Egypt ' ##s efforts to have Palestinian militant groups agree to a one ##- ##ye ##ar suspension of shooting ##s and bombings .
[unused1] [unused2] In a renewed media ##tion attempt , Egyptian en ##voy ##s have been holding meetings in Gaza and Damascus in recent days with leaders of the militant groups .
[unused1] [unused2] Israel said there will be no let ##up in its campaign against those involved in violence .
[unused1] [unused2] Israel ` ##` will continue to fight terror everywhere , at any time and in any way possible , ' ##' a Cabinet statement said Sunday , after a Hamas suicide bomber killed seven Israeli ##s on a Jerusalem bus earlier in the day .
[unused1] [unused2] The ministers also decided to cold ##- ##sh ##ou ##lder foreign en ##voy ##s who meet with Ara ##fa ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Whoever wants to visit Ara ##fa ##t can visit Ara ##fa ##t but he w ##o n ##' ##t be allowed to meet senior Israeli officials , ' ##' said a senior Sharon adviser , Ra ##ana ##n G ##iss ##in .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Not to forget I condemned it completely , these terrorist activities , ' ##' Ara ##fa ##t said Monday in halt ##ing English , speaking before the A ##ful ##a bombing .
[unused1] [unused2] Where did it happen that a president was forbidden from moving out of his office ? ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] The new Palestinian prime minister , Ma ##hm ##oud Abbas , has denounced violence against Israeli ##s , but also told Sharon in a weekend meeting _ the first Israeli ##- ##P ##ales ##tin ##ian summit in three years _ that he wants to persuade the militants to stop attacks , rather than di ##sar ##m them by force .
[unused1] [unused2] The plan calls for parallel steps in the first stage , including a Palestinian crack ##down on militants , an Israeli troop pull ##back from Palestinian towns and a construction freeze in Jewish settlements .
[unused1] [unused2] He was to have discussed his objections with U ##. ##S ##. President George W ##. Bush this week , but canceled his trip after Sunday ' ##s bus bombing .
[unused1] [unused2] The latest wave of attacks began Saturday evening when a Hamas bomber blew himself up in a square in the West Bank city of He ##bro ##n , killing an Israeli settler and his pregnant wife .
[unused1] [unused2] On Sunday morning , another Hamas ass ##ail ##ant blew up the Jerusalem bus and about half an hour later , a third bomber from the group de ##ton ##ated explosives on the outskirts of Jerusalem , killing only himself .
[unused1] [unused2] The Israeli military on Monday demolished the Q ##awa ##sm ##eh family home , part of a policy of trying to de ##ter attacks by punish ##ing ass ##ail ##ants ' relatives .
[unused1] [unused2] In another development , Israeli forensic ##s experts identified a body that washed up on a Tel Aviv beach last week as that of a B ##rito ##n , Omar Khan Sharif , 27 , the suspected a ##cco ##mp ##lice of a British suicide bomber who blew himself up outside a Tel Aviv pub April 30 .
[unused1] [unused2] Two musicians and a waitress were killed in the blast .
[unused1] [unused2] Sharif also carried explosives , but they did n ##' ##t go off , and he fled .
[unused1] [unused2] It was not known whether he was hurt at the time .
[unused1] [unused2] He said Sharif drowned .
[unused1] [unused2] Jordan ##ian authorities on Monday said Jordan ' ##s first female law ##maker was ineligible to run in June 17 parliamentary elections following her conviction last year over publishing information that harm ##ed the government ' ##s reputation .
[unused1] [unused2] To ##u ##jan F ##ais ##al , 54 , said she was informed of the refusal by an Interior Ministry committee overseeing election preparations .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The excuse is invalid because I ' ##ve been convicted on political not criminal grounds , which does n ##' ##t violate my right for contest ##ing the elections , ' ##' F ##ais ##al told The Associated Press .
[unused1] [unused2] F ##ais ##al was convicted in May 2002 for publishing false and exaggerated information abroad that harm ##ed the government ' ##s reputation and dignity .
[unused1] [unused2] She was sentenced to 1 - ##LC ##B ##- years in jail .
[unused1] [unused2] But after spending 40 days in prison , Jordan ' ##s King Abdullah II pardon ##ed the former leg ##is ##lator known for her harsh criticism of the state .
[unused1] [unused2] Jordan ' ##s electoral law ban ##s Jordan ##ians from contest ##ing the polls if they were convicted of any crime , except political , and sentenced to more than one year in jail .
[unused1] [unused2] She lost her seat in the 1997 election .
[unused1] [unused2] An explosion in a cafe at one of the capital ' ##s busiest intersection ##s killed one woman and injured another Tuesday , police said .
[unused1] [unused2] Police were investigating the cause of the explosion in the rest ##room of the multi ##sto ##ry C ##rocodile Cafe in the commercial district of Ki ##zi ##lay during the morning rush hour .
[unused1] [unused2] The blast shattered walls and windows in the building .
[unused1] [unused2] News reports suggested that the woman may have been a suicide bomber or may have died when the bomb she was planting exploded premature ##ly , but police and interior ministry officials refused to confirm the reports .
[unused1] [unused2] Ankara police chief E ##rc ##ume ##nt Yi ##lma ##z visited the site of the morning blast but refused to say if a bomb had caused the explosion .
[unused1] [unused2] There was no information on the identity of the injured person .
[unused1] [unused2] It was not clear how many people were in the cafe at the time of the blast .
[unused1] [unused2] The explosion comes a month after a bomb exploded at a McDonald ' ##s restaurant in Istanbul , causing damage but no injuries .
[unused1] [unused2] Radical left ##ist , Kurdish and Islamic groups are active in the country and have carried out bombings in the past .

[unused1] [unused2] The bombings killed 34 people _ including nine attackers , eight Americans and two B ##rito ##ns _ and wounded nearly 200 others .
[unused1] [unused2] Earlier this week , Saudi and U ##. ##S ##. officials said they had new intelligence pointing to O ##sa ##ma bin La ##den ' ##s al ##- ##Q ##aid ##a group possibly launching fresh attacks in the United States or against American interests overseas .
[unused1] [unused2] Israeli troops shot and killed a 16 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Palestinian boy and critically injured two children , ages 7 and 9 , during conflicts in the West Bank that erupted Tuesday as Israeli and Palestinian leaders moved toward talks on a new Mid ##eas ##t peace plan .
[unused1] [unused2] The shooting ##s _ which the Israeli army said came in response to attacks by Palestinians throwing stones and m ##olo ##tov cocktail ##s _ came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that Israel ' ##s occupation in the West Bank must end , stunning both do ##vis ##h opponents and hard ##line allies .
[unused1] [unused2] A summit between Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart , Ma ##hm ##oud Abbas , had been planned for Wednesday but was postponed , according to Israeli and Palestinian officials , who blamed each other for the delay .
[unused1] [unused2] The officials said no new date had been set ; Israel Radio said the meeting would take place Thursday .
[unused1] [unused2] A three ##- ##way summit with U ##. ##S ##. President George W ##. Bush could take place as early as next week , possibly in Jordan .
[unused1] [unused2] Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Palestinian boy and wounded a 7 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old boy after opening fire at stone throw ##ers in the Tu ##lk ##are ##m refugee camp in the West Bank on Tuesday , Palestinian hospital officials said .

[unused1] [unused2] Military sources said the Israeli army had established road ##block ##s at the entrance to Be ##it Han ##ou ##n to prevent Palestinians militants from leaving the area .
[unused1] [unused2] The sources said shots had been fired in the air when vehicles tried to skirt the road ##block ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] The violence erupted after Sharon endured with ##ering criticism Monday from members of his own Li ##ku ##d Party over his Cabinet ' ##s acceptance of the U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##back ##ed ` ##` road map ' ##' peace plan .
[unused1] [unused2] Sharon indicated a 180 ##- ##de ##g ##ree turn ##around after decades of warning that an Israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the West Bank could end ##anger Israel ' ##s existence .
[unused1] [unused2] Palestinians and their do ##vis ##h Israeli allies routinely use the word ` ##` occupation ' ##' when demanding that Israel leave the West Bank and Gaza and di ##sman ##tle Jewish settlements .
[unused1] [unused2] On Sunday , Sharon ' ##s Cabinet conditional ##ly approved the ` ##` road map , ' ##' a three ##- ##pha ##se plan that begins with a halt to violence and en ##vis ##ages a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2005 .
[unused1] [unused2] Sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political solution to the conflict , including an Israeli withdrawal from West Bank population centers .
[unused1] [unused2] Critics have said Sharon ' ##s long ##- ##held condition that all violence must stop before peace moves is un ##real ##istic and guarantees failure of any peace initiative , including the road map , thus releasing him from the necessity of following through on his remarks .
[unused1] [unused2] North Korea has told American law ##makers it already has nuclear weapons and intends to build more , a senior U ##. ##S ##. congress ##man said Monday after returning from a trip to the communist state .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` They admitted to having nuclear capability and weapons at this moment , ' ##' said Rep ##. C ##urt We ##ldon , who headed a delegation of U ##. ##S ##. law ##makers that visited P ##yon ##gy ##ang for three days ending Sunday .
[unused1] [unused2] We ##ldon ' ##s comments echoed those of U ##. ##S ##. officials following talks in Beijing in April .
[unused1] [unused2] They said that North Korea claimed during a pause in the formal talks that it already had nuclear weapons , but would give up the program in return for economic aid and security guarantees .
[unused1] [unused2] We ##ldon said at a news conference in Seoul that North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim K ##ye G ##wan repeated that claim during a dinner meeting .
[unused1] [unused2] During their visit to P ##yon ##gy ##ang , We ##ldon ' ##s delegation also met Cho ##e T ##ha ##e Bo ##k , chairman of North Korea ' ##s legislature , the Supreme People ' ##s Assembly .
[unused1] [unused2] They flew to Seoul on Sunday to brief South Korean officials on their Northern trip .

[unused1] [unused2] In meetings with South Korean officials , Wolf ##ow ##itz urged them to increase military spending on new technologies and telecommunications equipment , as U ##. ##S ##. forces have done .
[unused1] [unused2] He said upgrades would allow troops to react quicker to threats from the North and help reduce the possibility of a military conflict on the peninsula , not height ##en it .

[unused1] [unused2] Bass ##on was accused of directing South Africa ' ##s former apartheid regime ' ##s bio ##chemical efforts aimed at destroying its opponents .
[unused1] [unused2] The ruling by judges Pie ##t St ##re ##iche ##r and Mohamed Na ##v ##sa of the Supreme Court of Appeal , the highest appeals court in the country , means that Bass ##on can not be tried again and his a ##c ##qui ##tta ##l stands , the South African Press Association reported .

[unused1] [unused2] WA ##S ##H ##ING ##TO ##N _ Having punched through severely depleted Republican Guard divisions that formed Baghdad ' ##s outer defensive ring , U ##. ##S ##. Army and Marine forces are likely to pause again to test the Iraqi capital ' ##s inner defenses and wa ##all but e ##va ##porated under the weight of the U ##. ##S ##. assault .
[unused1] [unused2] Bet ` f ##ow Central Command chief Gen ##. Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _ whether to rush into the city of 5 million where Hussein ' ##s regime has gathered its most ##- ##tr ##ust ##ed forces or wait and see if the war can be won without paying the price of street ##- ##to ##- ##st ##reet urban fighting .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We are expecting ##n or at least planning for , a very difficult fight ahead , ' ##' Gen ##. Stanley M ##c ##C ##hr ##ys ##tal said at the Pentagon Tuesday .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Instead of an all ##- ##out assault , analysts expect the United States to follow the example of British forces outside the southern Iraqi city of Ba ##s ##ra .
[unused1] [unused2] They are likely to mount small pro ##bing patrols into the city to determine the level of Iraqi resistance .
[unused1] [unused2] If these patrols meet little opposition , thousands of troops could rush into the city .
[unused1] [unused2] If the Iraqi ##s respond forcefully , the Army and Marine units could withdraw and a ##wai ##t the 4th Me ##chanized Infantry Division , which will soon start moving north from Kuwait .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Before going in - ##LR ##B ##- with a full assault - ##R ##RB ##- , you have to decide if it ' ##s worth the risks , and ... you have to know who ' ##s there in the way of Iraqi forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians , ' ##' he said .
[unused1] [unused2] Thousands of refugees have fled the city , apparently providing information to the British that has led to raids on military and Ba ##ath Party sites in the city .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The key end ##game may be whether the U ##. ##S ##. can par ##se out the key regime centers of power in Baghdad and attack them without having to fight into the city , or at least locate them well enough to at ##man of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily war report .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. s ##trate ##gis ##ts say that Hussein , if he is still alive and in control of his forces , might like a bloody battle in Baghdad because such fighting could cause heavy U ##. ##S ##. casualties .
[unused1] [unused2] His last hope for survival might be that the United States loses its taste for such losses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would allow Hussein and his family to keep power in Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` If U ##. ##S ##. forces seriously de ##grade Iraq ' ##s half ##- ##do ##zen Republican Guard divisions before that final battle , and only have to face perhaps 30 ##, ##00 ##0 Special Republican Guard , fed ##ay ##een , and related personnel , the task will not be as hard as it might have been , ' ##' he said .
[unused1] [unused2] While two guard divisions have apparently been smashed , there are three others in the Baghdad area .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammer ##ing at every level and is now scattered and deploy ##ing somewhat erratic ##ally at the brigade level , ' ##' he said .
[unused1] [unused2] The Iraqi ##s still have n ##' ##t used chemical weapons , even though many experts feared such attacks as the U ##. ##S ##. troops neared Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] But he also said , ` ##` He may destroy them to em ##bar ##rass us , ' ##' to show the world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for no reason other than aggression .
[unused1] [unused2] But in such close ##- ##qua ##rter ##s fighting , they would lose much of the technological advantage of their air supremacy , which would have to be cu ##rta ##iled because bombing in a city can cause large civilian casualties .
[unused1] [unused2] But there would be lots of casualties on all sides , ' ##' Ko ##rb said .

[unused1] [unused2] Most Beijing travel agencies have suspended tourist trips to the Middle East as tension height ##ens in the Gulf region , Thursday ' ##s Beijing Youth Daily reports .
[unused1] [unused2] Out of security concerns , major travel agencies , including the China International Travel Service , China Travel Service and China Youth Tourism Service , have temporarily suspended tours to Egypt and Turkey for Chinese tourists .
[unused1] [unused2] According to Du ##n Ji ##dong of the China Travel Service , once war breaks out between the United States and Iraq , not only will Middle East travel routes be frozen but the entire overseas travel business will be affected .
[unused1] [unused2] The only few travel agencies still organizing visits to the Middle East have increased their prices by 500 to 600 Yuan - ##LR ##B ##- 60 to 72 US dollars - ##R ##RB ##- .

[unused1] [unused2] Last Saturday night , rebels in the Central Africa Republic , captured the airport in the capital city of Bang ##ui and the residence of President Ang ##e ##- ##F ##eli ##x Pat ##ass ##e , who is out of the country .
[unused1] [unused2] The rebels have captured the country ' ##s main international airport , said a top official in a 300 ##- ##stro ##ng African security force policing the city .
[unused1] [unused2] The rebels identified themselves to residents in the city as troops loyal to former general staff Gen ##. Franco ##is Bo ##zi ##ze , who staged a foil ##ed coup bid in October .
[unused1] [unused2] Five Iraqi civilians , including a woman , were killed Monday when their houses were hit by a missile fired by the US ##- ##led coalition war ##planes , witnesses said .
[unused1] [unused2] One house was destroyed during the strike and casualties have been removed from the area .
[unused1] [unused2] The US ##- ##led coalition forces launched a new round of airs ##tri ##kes on Baghdad at 2 ##: ##30 p ##. ##m ##. - ##LR ##B ##- 113 ##0 ##GM ##T - ##R ##RB ##- on Monday .
[unused1] [unused2] Hu ##ge explosions were heard in different parts of Baghdad and air raid sire ##n sounded throughout the capital city , they said , adding that Iraqi anti ##- ##air ##craft artillery had begun to fire back .
[unused1] [unused2] Although the coalition leaders have repeatedly assured that every effort would be made to minimize civilian casualties in the current Iraq war , at least 130 Iraqi civilians have been reportedly killed since the war started five days ago .
[unused1] [unused2] According to other reports reaching here , five Syrian bus passengers were killed and 10 others were injured on Sunday morning when a US missile hit the bus they were traveling in near the Iraqi border .

[unused1] [unused2] A two ##- ##day summit between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W ##. Bush ended here Tuesday with both countries trying to minimize splits on UN role in rebuilding Iraq after the ongoing US ##- ##led war against the country is over .
[unused1] [unused2] As the US ##- ##led coalition troops are reportedly thrusting into Baghdad and the second Iraqi city of Ba ##s ##ra , Blair and Bush agreed there would be a ` ##` vital role ' ##' for the United Nations in post ##- ##war Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] During their first war summit on March 27 at Camp David , Blair and Bush became divided over what a role the United Nations will play in postwar Iraq , when Bush gave no positive reaction to Blair ' ##s suggestion of a strong UN role .
[unused1] [unused2] After the Camp David talks , Blair , who analysts say has been pursuing a special relationship with Washington in order to restore Britain ' ##s traditional role as a trans ##at ##lant ##ic ` ##` bridge ' ##' , was forced to read ##ju ##st his tone .
[unused1] [unused2] Blair and Bush were expected to bridge their gap on the issue by reaching an agreement on UN role in post ##- ##war Iraq , some analysts said even before this summit at Hills ##borough , south of Belfast , the second of its kind since the war broke out on March 20 .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We welcome the appointment by the United Nations Secretary - General of a special adviser for Iraq to work with the people of Iraq and coalition representatives , ' ##' the statement added .
[unused1] [unused2] It was a ` ##` false choice ' ##' to debate whether Iraq should be run by coalition forces or the United Nations , said Blair , who was believed to be in favor of a stronger UN role in post ##- ##con ##f ##lic ##t Iraq than Bush .
[unused1] [unused2] Echo ##ing Blair , Bush said the UN would play a role in all aspects of post ##- ##war Iraq , from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority , adding that Iraq would ` ##` move as quickly as possible ' ##' to an interim authority made up of Iraqi ##s from inside and outside the country .
[unused1] [unused2] Yet , analysts argued , both Britain and the United States hope their agreed vision of a postwar scenario will p ##la ##cate anti ##- ##war nations such as France , Germany and Russia .
[unused1] [unused2] Blair also pleaded the world to avoid ` ##` endless diplomatic w ##rang ##les ' ##' over the future of Iraq like the international dispute over a second UN resolution on Iraq that preceded the war .
[unused1] [unused2] France and Germany , which were most vocal in opposing this US - led war against Iraq , have been insisting that the United Nations should play a central role in the phase of post ##- ##war Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] In order to improve the epidemic control , Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture Chu ##i Sai On , who has been named director of the SA ##RS task force by the government , has designated representatives from the Health Services and the Center for Disease Prevention and Control to visit neighboring Guangdong Province on Thursday , to learn from Guangdong ' ##s experience and know ##- ##how in combat ##ing SA ##RS , which have been acknowledged by WHO .

[unused1] [unused2] Ba ##' ##as ##yi ##r was not officially charged with the Bali bombing last October , but police said he gave his blessing to the Bali per ##pet ##rators .

[unused1] [unused2] On May 5 , 10 hostages held by the FA ##RC were killed during an attempt to rescue them by the army .
[unused1] [unused2] Reyes said in his letter that the ` ##` guerrilla units are in the moral obligation of saving and protecting lives and physical integrity of their prisoners . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] The rebels ` ##` in any case can not allow to have its prisoners to be taken away by enemy forces without a military response , ' ##' he added .

[unused1] [unused2] Leadership can be less rigid ##ly defined and is concerned less with coordination than motivation and how a commander seeks to inspire his men to fight harder and endure worse p ##ri ##vations in order to beat the enemy .
[unused1] [unused2] His planning for the war was inadequate and his monitoring of the war after the invasion failed to correct course in the face of the change in circumstances brought by a strong and unexpected ins ##urgency .
[unused1] [unused2] That has not been the case with President Bush , who un ##leashed hell acting on fault ##y intelligence , failed to find any W ##MD , and left our boys at war wanting for armor .
[unused1] [unused2] That is not the sort of generals ##hip that on rational grounds alone m ##ot ##ivate ##s men to march to possible death .
[unused1] [unused2] In theory , motivation is best carried out by a commander fighting alongside his men .
[unused1] [unused2] Make no mistake , even when we do n ##' ##t desire a president with a preference for personal combat , the need for a commander to be seen to share dangers with his men is as imp ##erative today as it was in times of Alexander of Mace ##don .
[unused1] [unused2] John Kennedy , George H ##. Bush , and even John Kerry , the loser , had distinguished military careers that were a ##pt substitute ##s for leading men in battle .
[unused1] [unused2] The knowledge that the Commander ##- ##in ##- ##C ##hi ##ef once faced grave danger in war brave ##ly can be the an ##imating spirit of troops facing the same dangers .
[unused1] [unused2] In fact , CBS and carrier landings not ##with ##standing , there is every indication that in the peak of youth he avoided the dangers of war as much as he could .
[unused1] [unused2] That is not the sort of leadership that on emotional grounds alone m ##ot ##ivate ##s men to march to possible death .
[unused1] [unused2] The aim of grand strategy is a prosperous and secure peace , and by his several b ##lund ##ers over the psychology of his opponents , the political and economic effects of his actions , and the failure to er ##rad ##ica ##te terrorism and even capture he most wanted terrorist , George W ##. Bush , he has failed to realize the aim of grand strategy .
[unused1] [unused2] Are you willing to pay with a deficit of billion ##s , thousands of Americans dead or badly wounded , and the un ##me ##as ##urable disruption that a foreign war causes to the life of our nation at all levels , for each country in the world that is in the grip of a t ##yra ##nt ?
[unused1] [unused2] But un ##ila ##teral ##ly , or worse leading a coalition featuring t ##yra ##nn ##ies , effect such change remains a bad idea , Iraq ' ##s elections not ##with ##standing .
[unused1] [unused2] The interim government did n ##' ##t hesitate to torture opponents , just like Saddam did .
[unused1] [unused2] I have contacted the U ##AC ##C and told them about it so they can check the auction ##s - ##LR ##B ##- she ' ##s been doing this a long time - ##R ##RB ##- and to tell me if she ' ##s actually a registered member .
[unused1] [unused2] The only thing that being a U ##AC ##C member means is that they paid membership due ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] La ##D ##ou ##ce says e ##- ##mail ##s were dispatched to Indonesian officials , but he does n ##' ##t know what happened to the information . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s too bad those NO ##AA people had n ##' ##t used the telephone .
[unused1] [unused2] Thousands could die .
[unused1] [unused2] On the other hand , if you were a scientist at NO ##AA and were into saving people from tsunami ##s , you would think you might have figured out before ##hand who you might call if you did get some advanced warning of such an event .
[unused1] [unused2] You can bet they are figuring out who they should have call next time .
[unused1] [unused2] We just learned that our friend ' ##s daughter when to Thailand to visit her father after the wave hit .
[unused1] [unused2] I was researching Meg Till ##y on the internet and thus accidentally found out that Jennifer Till ##y was born Jennifer Chan .
[unused1] [unused2] Love ##ly , she refuses an auto ##psy which could prove how her husband died , but then she turns around and makes accusations like this against his treatment , and in effect , his doctors .
[unused1] [unused2] I saw that show and did n ##' ##t think she was accusing anyone of anything , more trying to explain to people why he died so suddenly .
[unused1] [unused2] I often wondered how he was doing with all the me ##ds because of his illness , which developed before his para ##ly ##zing accident .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m not sure about this disagreement you are speaking of between her version and the doctors version of his cause of death .
[unused1] [unused2] Maybe the Dr ##. ##s had h ##y ##pot ##hes ##ized possibilities at the time of death and in the months since then , they may thought of other reasons I do n ##' ##t know .
[unused1] [unused2] People are interested to know how she ' ##s doing after having lost such a big part of her life , and this really was more what the interview was about .
[unused1] [unused2] What I think was quite app ##all ##ing from what Dana said on the Op ##rah show was that the doctors wanted to pull the life support from Chris * without her being there .
[unused1] [unused2] There has always been that urban legend that the Israeli secret police murdered the Shah of Iran by in ##fect ##ing him with p ##lut ##onium , which manifest ##ed itself into terminal lung cancer .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t doubt that this method has been used to remove various th ##orn ##s over the years , but why on earth would Israel have wanted to get rid of the Shah ?
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t mean to suggest that I agree with anything David Fr ##um says , but these Ara ##fa ##t ##- ##had ##- ##A ##ID ##S allegations remind me of what happened with the late Israeli singer Of ##ra Ha ##za , where there was a lot of speculation , a mysterious death from a ` ##` blood disease , ' ##' and then it came out eventually that she ' ##d died of AIDS .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- Although I would think the Israeli media , who were blamed for h ##ushing up Ha ##za ' ##s cause of death , would take a unique pleasure in making the most of Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s , if all this was true . - ##R ##RB ##-
[unused1] [unused2] The ` ##` suspicious evidence ' ##' is simply that Ara ##fa ##t did not look particularly near death when he was removed from his HQ .
[unused1] [unused2] He appeared alert and functioning , certainly not a week away from death from wasting .
[unused1] [unused2] Who really benefits from his death ?
[unused1] [unused2] Are Kiss ##inger Associates trying to start a ` ##` Palestinian Civil War ' ##' like their Lebanese one a generation ago ?
[unused1] [unused2] A political public service message brought to you by Clear Channel . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Did you know that one of the largest media companies in the country was in the business of bringing you ` ##` political public service messages ? ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Two of my nephew ##s were excluded from their brother ' ##s wedding this weekend because they are not LDS .
[unused1] [unused2] Both were extremely hurt , particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later .
[unused1] [unused2] I got a sort of an i ##cky feeling when I realized the only people who did attend the kid ' ##s wedding was his un ##med ##ica ##ted bi ##- ##pol ##ar mother and his father , who suffers from Alzheimer ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] The religion that is afraid of science dish ##ono ##rs God and commit ##s suicide .
[unused1] [unused2] I really think it ' ##s time for the church to admit that a civil ceremony followed by a temple sealing reaches the same goal , often in a more loving way , than insisting that only the sealing is worth doing .
[unused1] [unused2] There ' ##s been a thread recently in one of the ex ##M ##o for ##a about a woman whose bishop , who she had been planning to have marry her , was going out of town , so she asked the stake president , who she did n ##' ##t know well .
[unused1] [unused2] He insisted that he needed to make the point , as part of performing the ceremony , that she really needed to be married in the temple , even though her fi ##ance was not LDS .
[unused1] [unused2] * shrugs * I chose to have a civil ceremony largely because my wife and I were both converts and a temple ceremony would have excluded both families completely .
[unused1] [unused2] Unfortunately we started off on the wrong foot for a lot of reasons and the marriage did n ##' ##t last .
[unused1] [unused2] I ca n ##' ##t help but wonder if perhaps we did ourselves a di ##ser ##vice by not getting sealed ##i n ##tial ##ly , and making our marriage a gospel focused one .
[unused1] [unused2] For my part though , I think we started the marriage with a compromise and dei ##ned ourselves tremendous blessing and ultimately paid the price .
[unused1] [unused2] I wonder how many success stories are out there from people who chose to have a civil ceremony , and went on later to be happily sealed .
[unused1] [unused2] I know that was what happened with my own parents , largely because their decision to get married and my father ' ##s decision to join the church came very close together , and they did n ##' ##t want to wait the year until he would be able to enter the temple .
[unused1] [unused2] I think divorce is really stupid .
[unused1] [unused2] First off , I ' ##m remarried , divorced 3 years ago .
[unused1] [unused2] I wonder if B had a huge messy divorce , and his ex took the kid out of state .
[unused1] [unused2] Di ##vor ##ce really sucks .
[unused1] [unused2] I have my kids almost 50 ##/ ##50 these days , but it was a huge messy post divorce compromise that took a year to complete .
[unused1] [unused2] Perhaps my ex ##wife has more sympathy for what its like to be a guy on the receiving end of a divorce now ?
[unused1] [unused2] She wrote an article about a divorce support group , ending it with something about Mrs ##. B being happily married but she ' ##s impressed by the divorce support group .
[unused1] [unused2] Sometimes we want to see marriage one dimensional ##ly .
[unused1] [unused2] Either its bad or good .
[unused1] [unused2] I know my first marriage had a lot of good adventures , a lot of friendship , a lot of love .
[unused1] [unused2] Oh , yeah , it was n ##' ##t perfect .
[unused1] [unused2] They say it takes one year for every two that you were married .
[unused1] [unused2] My wife ' ##s name is M ##. We ' ##re going to a bed and breakfast this weekend , to get away , relax .
[unused1] [unused2] Although , the dog thing is really post divorce .
[unused1] [unused2] Sometimes I look at the old photos , before divorce .
[unused1] [unused2] I was one of the first digital camera users , and I have too many photos from my first marriage .
[unused1] [unused2] If my ex ##wife does n ##' ##t dump B , maybe they ' ##ll wind up staying together , maybe even getting married .
[unused1] [unused2] Di ##vor ##ce seems really really stupid .
[unused1] [unused2] I did get a good bunch of the wedding photos , but my ex refused to give them all to me saying it was ` ##` his life too ' ##' even though I really re ##sent them being under the same roof with his child ##- ##bri ##de .
[unused1] [unused2] My mother took his re ##mar ##ria ##ge harder than I did , I think , because of that .
[unused1] [unused2] Di ##vor ##ce * is * really stupid .
[unused1] [unused2] Especially for those of us who still have so many years - ##LR ##B ##- if one year for every 2 married , then I ' ##ve still got another 7 or so - ##R ##RB ##- to go to get our heads screwed back on and find some sort of life that rivals what we had or what our ex has or what you and your ex have .
[unused1] [unused2] Dell is involved in a class action suit for ` ##` bait and switch ' ##' , where a nurse claims Dell switched parts and charged her for the more expensive items , and for promising ` ##` easy credit ' ##' for which no one q ##ual ##ifies and then charges ridiculous ##ly high interest rates .
[unused1] [unused2] the only to ##rt reform that i think should be done is to cap fees that lawyers are allowed to extract for class action suits .
[unused1] [unused2] i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such actions ... but from a monetary perspective the only real winners from class actions are the lawyers .
[unused1] [unused2] i remember once receiving a fifty cent check in an envelope with post ##age of at least half that amount for the great 17 ' ##' monitor class action suit .
[unused1] [unused2] Then there was the class action suit against Gateway brought by some Philadelphia lawyers a number of years ago .
[unused1] [unused2] So the lawyers sued Gateway , and the settlement approved by the judge consisted of me ##ga ##bu ##cks for the lawyers and coup ##ons to owners of Gateway 48 ##6 computers .
[unused1] [unused2] Believe it or not there are companies that go over the line and need to be hit with a stick called a law suit .
[unused1] [unused2] It seems the fear of law suits is the only thing that keeps some of these crooked companies in line .
[unused1] [unused2] The only people who profit from class actions are the lawyers .
[unused1] [unused2] Since companies are going to be sued in class action , regardless of the merits of the case , the threat of a class action is not a de ##tri ##ment .
[unused1] [unused2] If you do n ##' ##t believe that , witness the V ##io ##x ##x lawsuits .
[unused1] [unused2] Because of that , it is being sued .
[unused1] [unused2] They are not being sued .
[unused1] [unused2] Doing the right thing provides no protection from class action .
[unused1] [unused2] All class actions do is en ##rich lawyers and raise costs to everyone .
[unused1] [unused2] The cost of class actions is factor ##ed into the cost of everything you buy .
[unused1] [unused2] I would like to make a donation to help the survivors of the tsunami .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##ve heard mostly positive things about how the Red Cross is handling their donations , with a very high percentage of the donated funds going directly for relief and not for administrative expenses .
[unused1] [unused2] So that is the channel we chose for our own donation .
[unused1] [unused2] Actually more of the money from your donation has a chance of going directly toward its intended purpose than any other charity .
[unused1] [unused2] The Red Cross normally de ##duct ##s 9 % from all de ##duction ##s for its ad ##mini ##stra ##tic ##e costs .
[unused1] [unused2] It has announced that it will fore ##go the 9 % on donations ear ##marked for tsunami relief and that 100 % of these funds will go directly toward aid .
[unused1] [unused2] 9 % in administrative costs would place the Red Cross among charity organizations making the the most efficient use of donated funds .
[unused1] [unused2] Money from private donations has been flowing into charitable relief organizations at an unprecedented rate , in some cases by millions of dollars per hour .
[unused1] [unused2] Although the need for help is still continuing , some individual charities have announced that they have already received as much in donations as they can put to use for this effort .
[unused1] [unused2] This is why we want to let you know that at this time , MS ##F estimates that we have received sufficient funds for our currently fore ##see ##n emergency response in South Asia . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] They also stated that there are lots of places in the world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too - quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are getting less donations now .
[unused1] [unused2] So they did n ##' ##t disco ##urage donations to them per se , just not for this specific area .
[unused1] [unused2] if you are going to give assistance then L ##O ##OK with suspicion at all they do it is better to keep your $ $ $ .
[unused1] [unused2] Oh well , lets cross now to our mob of mind ##less drone ##s and hear about how good it is that this men ##ace to society is going to be locked up before he kills all our innocent children .
[unused1] [unused2] The way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you ' ##re below . ##0 ##5 .
[unused1] [unused2] In this case the off ##ender escaped conviction first time around because it was accepted that he attempted to get rid of the keys , which supposedly landed in his lap .
[unused1] [unused2] Or what if I were in a bar with the car outside , keys in my pocket , but I ' ##ve decided I ' ##ll take the train home later ?
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m reminded of when I lived in another state and the local cop charged the town drunk in his driveway after following him home from the pub .
[unused1] [unused2] The drunk was acquitted on the technical ##ity that he was n ##' ##t on a public road when the cop arrested him .
[unused1] [unused2] I am the head of a company that raised an angel round of financing from a San Francisco angel investor who I never physically met initially .
[unused1] [unused2] the CEO ##S and ex ##ec ##s of companies such as Fred Smith of F ##ED ##EX , Norman Wait ##t Of Gateway , Jeff S ##ko ##ll of E ##bay , Roger Marino of E ##MC , Marc Turtle ##ta ##ub of The Money Store , Marc Cuban ##/ ##T ##od ##d Wagner , and others have all parked their money in film ventures and deals similar to ours ,
[unused1] [unused2] I need a similar self made entrepreneur who recently sold his company ; is currently at the helm of one ; or , a recently exited executive with a large se ##verance pay who is sitting in the middle of nowhere , USA , is bored , and has always secretly wanted to get into the film business for tax , van ##ity , or alternative investment reasons .
[unused1] [unused2] I have 2 girls already , nearly 8 and 4 ##. ##5 y ##rs and I have always said I will NE ##VE ##R forget the pain of child ##birth .
[unused1] [unused2] Abby was a true water birth - ##LR ##B ##- 3 ##k ##g - normal - ##R ##RB ##- and with Fiona I was dragged out of the pool after the head crowned - ##LR ##B ##- g ##yn ##o had written on my notes she was 4 ##k ##g - ##LR ##B ##- large - ##R ##RB ##- and that she was not to be born in the water - ##LR ##B ##- long painful story ! - ##R ##RB ##-
[unused1] [unused2] I am on the large side but I am so worried about how I ' ##m going to cope with a natural child ##birth without a pool - ##LR ##B ##- not available round here - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] If you do n ##' ##t have an institutional water birth available , have you considered just staying home ?
[unused1] [unused2] I understand h ##y ##p ##nob ##irt ##hing can be very helpful .
[unused1] [unused2] If you go for a home birth you can rent a birth ##ing pool .
[unused1] [unused2] So do n ##' ##t give up on the idea of a natural birth because last time was painful .
[unused1] [unused2] My girlfriend was on the run from probation in F ##la when she got herself in trouble here in A ##z ##. .
[unused1] [unused2] A ##z in trouble in 2001 , fl ##a is mentioned and she signs another wa ##iver of extra ##dition , posts bonds and skip ##s - ##LR ##B ##- not far enough app ##aran ##tly - ##R ##RB ##-
[unused1] [unused2] A ##z troubles again in 2004 , she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 y ##rs probation her in a ##z , fl ##a shows up and takes her to fl ##a face ##ing her original 1999 charges which are still open - ##LR ##B ##- she failed mi ##ser ##ably at probation - ##R ##RB ##- I think they want to give her 3 years .
[unused1] [unused2] The wa ##iver of extra ##dition that she signed simply means that if she skip ##s out and goes to another state , she ca n ##' ##t contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction , and that the court w ##o n ##' ##t have to initiate the time ##- ##con ##suming process of extra ##dit ##ing her .
[unused1] [unused2] 2 ` ##` F ##TA ` ##` s - ##LR ##B ##- failure to appear - ##R ##RB ##- , one in FL and one in A ##Z , plus whatever the original charges were in both cases .
[unused1] [unused2] All the FL prosecutors have to do is ask , and the A ##Z jail ##ers will pack her up in a van or a plane and ship her back to FL for trial on the F ##TA charge and probably to commence her serving time under the suspended sentence that went along with her original probation .
[unused1] [unused2] They let her serve her time in A ##Z , then they come and get her to serve her time in FL .
[unused1] [unused2] T ##hum ##b your nose at the court often enough , and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your head , re ##- ##ins ##ti ##tu ##ting the original suspended sentences and possibly adding on for the F ##TA .
[unused1] [unused2] It lets them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be entitled to , in order to ship her from one state to another .
[unused1] [unused2] But they were entitled to demand that wa ##iver as a condition of probation ; if she had not agreed to voluntarily wa ##ive that right , they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she would n ##' ##t have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether .
[unused1] [unused2] She will probably have to serve out her sentence in FL , AND if she has not already served all her time in A ##Z , they will then ship her back there to do T ##HA ##T time .
[unused1] [unused2] On the fourth day of his stay , he was moved out of the I ##CU to the step ##- ##down unit , with a diagnosis of ` ##` I ##CU P ##sy ##cho ##sis secondary to na ##rc ##otic administration ' ##' and post th ##ora ##cos ##tom ##y . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] During the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day , he got up , dressed , pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and across four lanes of busy evening traffic , to our apartment .
[unused1] [unused2] By the time he got to our home , he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly who told me ` ##` he ' ##s crazy and just walked out . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Then the orderly was apparently rude to him , and that ' ##s when he got up and decided to come home .
[unused1] [unused2] A short time later , two police officers showed up and told me they had to take him back to the hospital .
[unused1] [unused2] At 2 ##: ##15 the next morning , I received a call from the night shift supervisor who told me my friend had been ` ##` verbal ##ly abusive and aggressive ' ##' and would I come over and talk to him .
[unused1] [unused2] So , I went over there , getting to his room right at 2 ##: ##30 .
[unused1] [unused2] A nurse said , ` ##` He beat two of us up .
[unused1] [unused2] The cops are here because we ' ##re pressing charges . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] I asked to speak to the two nurses whom he ' ##d all ##ed ##ged ##ly hit and was told I could n ##' ##t do that .
[unused1] [unused2] He was sent to another hospital with a ps ##ych unit until his ps ##ych ##osis resolved .
[unused1] [unused2] I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery , then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident .
[unused1] [unused2] I was given a copy of a different citation , but with the identical information from the one I ' ##d gotten the night of the incident .
[unused1] [unused2] The police report has the victim saying she was ` ##` choked to where she almost lost consciousness , struck in the face with a belt b ##uckle and it had left large marks , and that he ' ##d grabbed her breasts and left marks .
[unused1] [unused2] According to the police report , this woman never reported to the ER for ve ##rification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to pro ##voke this incident .
[unused1] [unused2] He was cited for simple assault and battery .
[unused1] [unused2] Also , I was looking at both citation ##s , I did n ##' ##t get to the hospital until 2 ##: ##30 am , and the officer has the time of incident as being at 2 ##: ##34 am .
[unused1] [unused2] The hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems , and they imp ##roper ##ly treated him by not sending him to a ps ##ych ward , which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone .
[unused1] [unused2] Sue them for ma ##l ##pra ##ctic ##e , and make the number big enough to get some serious attention .
[unused1] [unused2] The foreign minister of North Korea has state that North Korea has nuclear weapons and has officially with drawn from the 6 nation talks on Nuclear proliferation in east Asia .
[unused1] [unused2] The Foreign minister also indicated that North Korea will continue to develop long range missiles capable of o ##b ##lite ##rating any target within the borders of the United States .
[unused1] [unused2] Missile ##s launched from these vessels are said to be able to hit 90 % percent of the major cities with in 2 and one half minutes from time of launch .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t know about the rest of you but I think that in the next few weeks I will be moving supplies and equipment to my site in eastern Oregon .
[unused1] [unused2] Now the nut of the question should be , What if Iran gives , sells , provides nuclear weapons to Islamic ex ##tre ##mist ##s to smug ##gle into the United States and at 10 AM on a Wednesday pop 2 or 3 in New York City , destroying Wall street , the large banks , the large Insurance companies , the large so ##ck broker ##age houses and many other world wide financial institutions .
[unused1] [unused2] At the same time 2 weapons go off in Washington DC and take out the President , the Vice President , 80 Senators , and 350 congress ##men as well as the department of the treasury , Interior , Health and Welfare , Justice , Commerce and the Federal Court system .
[unused1] [unused2] And then just for y ##ucks lets assume that one goes off at the Pentagon .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course the above does not take into account that people driven by fear do n ##' ##t riot and lo ##ot every thing in site in the first week .
[unused1] [unused2] If the attack should happen in the winter , no Natural gas from Canada to heat homes , or fire steam driven electrical generators .
[unused1] [unused2] Oh we can work on the assumption that the Mu ##llah ##s of Iran will be rational , - ##LR ##B ##- but how rational are people who train and fund suicide bombers - ##R ##RB ##- and a rational Kim Jun ##k Il ##l - ##LR ##B ##- who lets large numbers of his people star ##ve to death every year so he can have nuclear weapons - ##R ##RB ##- kidnap ##s Japanese Citizens to teach English , Kid ##nap ##s movie stars so he can have private performances etc ##. .
[unused1] [unused2] Just heard yesterday that He ##wl ##ett Packard is shutting down its plant in Eugene , - ##LR ##B ##- Thank you very much MS ##. Fi ##ori ##na - ##R ##RB ##- and S ##UN Micro systems is all but gone from Oregon .
[unused1] [unused2] My uncle declared bankruptcy in 2003 and his case closed in June 2004 .
[unused1] [unused2] If I give him shares in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30 % shareholder , and I finally distributed profit this year , will the creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005 ?
[unused1] [unused2] But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcy filing ##s , and did n ##' ##t , the answer may be different .
[unused1] [unused2] I think , though , that any transaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life .
[unused1] [unused2] Since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge , the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts .
[unused1] [unused2] You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pro ##nto ; this is a bankruptcy matter , not a tax matter .
[unused1] [unused2] the bank ##rup ##cy filing took place in 2003 , but it didn ##t clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares .
[unused1] [unused2] Yes , but according to the facts you first gave , he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares .
[unused1] [unused2] I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge did n ##' ##t come until June of 2004 .
[unused1] [unused2] That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy , which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors .
[unused1] [unused2] A bankruptcy case does n ##' ##t close until you get the discharge order , and until then everything that the debt ##or receives is fair game for the trustee .
[unused1] [unused2] If , however , your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court , then as a general matter the creditors can not go after the shares , unless they can prove that there was co ##llus ##ion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them - ##LR ##B ##- e ##. ##g ##. , by putting his assets in the corporation ' ##s name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] A serial killer in Wichita , Kansas who killed at least 8 people in the ' ##70 ##s and ' ##80 ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] BT ##K stands for bind , torture , and kill .
[unused1] [unused2] He sent several letters to the police and the media during that time .
[unused1] [unused2] You do well to wonder why the BT ##K killer was not captured until yesterday .
[unused1] [unused2] - The BT ##K killer once called up a police dispatch ##er and told her of the crime he just committed , and still they could not catch him
[unused1] [unused2] The rich hire private security for a reason - ##- public security is often inadequate .
[unused1] [unused2] I think it ' ##s Bin ##d , Tor ##ture and Kill .
[unused1] [unused2] I believe Bin ##d Tor ##ture Kill = BT ##K .
[unused1] [unused2] What ' ##s the deal with parole ?
[unused1] [unused2] If you get out on parole , what happens then , and how long does it last ?
[unused1] [unused2] And , again fairly specifically - ##LR ##B ##- and I realise this is state specific , but I ' ##m kinda looking for a general answer here - ##R ##RB ##- : if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12 ##- ##14 year olds , and gets put away for , say , three years , is this the sort of deal where he ' ##s likely to get parole , or just do the time and leave again ?
[unused1] [unused2] Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time .
[unused1] [unused2] So you ' ##re basically free , with the expectation that you will not leave the state - ##LR ##B ##- assuming you ' ##ve been jailed by the state go ##v ` t - ##R ##RB ##- and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis - ##LR ##B ##- I think they give you a schedule - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] As for how long it lasts , I would say that it lasts for the rest of your sentence , but I ' ##m not sure about that .
[unused1] [unused2] Also , you can call someone to come pick you up when you leave , or call a taxi I guess .
[unused1] [unused2] For some reason , I ca n ##' ##t recall if selling drugs to minors q ##ual ##ifies as a jury trial or what .
[unused1] [unused2] You have to provide a planned residence when you ' ##re considered for parole , usually a relative or program of some kind .
[unused1] [unused2] It lasts as long as the rest of your sentence lasts .
[unused1] [unused2] You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole , for a period of time up until your sentence runs out .
[unused1] [unused2] Pa ##rol ##e is not a right and its granting is discretion ##ary .
[unused1] [unused2] Indeed , New York ' ##s statute says , ` ##` Disc ##ret ##ion ##ary release on parole shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient performance of duties while confined but after considering if there is a reasonable probability that , if such in ##mate is released , he will live and remain at liberty without violating the law , and that his release is not in ##com ##pa ##tible with the welfare of society and will not so de ##p ##re ##cate the serious ##ness of his crime as to under ##mine respect for law . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- Instead , there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior , or of creating strong pre ##sumption ##s in favor of parole release . - ##R ##RB ##-
[unused1] [unused2] Here on the left edge of the country , we have a unique perspective on election standards .
[unused1] [unused2] In Iraq , an election takes place in which one of the three major forces v ##ying for control of the country op ##ts out .
[unused1] [unused2] A few people will turn out and elect somebody .
[unused1] [unused2] Following the election and re ##co ##unt process exactly as outlined in our state constitution , the democratic candidate won by a margin of less than 200 votes .
[unused1] [unused2] The same group of people who have said ` ##` even if some regions are too un ##safe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome , some election is better than no election , and it ' ##s a great day for democracy !
[unused1] [unused2] ' ##' ... are su ##ing to overthrow the results of the governor ' ##s election is Washington State because there were some ` ##` errors ' ##' in the process .
[unused1] [unused2] So the standards are : Any old process halfway resembling an election is just did ##dly da ##ndy in Iraq , but we w ##o n ##' ##t accept the results of a free and fair election in Washington State because there may have been a human error rate of 0 ##. ##00 ##00 ##00 ##1 percent .
[unused1] [unused2] In Washington State , the election has to be not only free and fair , but also ` ##` perfect ' ##' .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- Of course , the Republicans would have thought the WA State election * was * perfect , had their candidate held the same 100 and some vote margin when all the smoke finally cleared - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] Everyone , everywhere should have the basic right to elect their government .
[unused1] [unused2] The problem with this election is that no matter what happens the results are going to be ta ##inted and questionable .
[unused1] [unused2] Think about this objective ##ly - ##LR ##B ##- forget the US is involved - ##R ##RB ##- , if a foreign country invaded another and set up elections , would n ##' ##t a reasonable person question the validity of the election results ?
[unused1] [unused2] Say it ' ##s 1942 , and the German o ##cc ##up ##iers in Holland have set up elections with Dutch candidates .
[unused1] [unused2] Even if you , John H , believe the US held imp ##art ##ial elections in Iraq , do n ##' ##t you think the rest of the world will find the results invalid , or least suspect ?
[unused1] [unused2] If Lou Do ##bbs , on CNN , at 6 ##: ##10 Eastern , can say , ` ##` This election was a success by any measure , ' ##' that ' ##s good enough for me .
[unused1] [unused2] You have to start somewhere and this election is to get a legislative body to write a constitution for Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] The next election will be the one with more legitimacy .
[unused1] [unused2] According to this person Kerry won decisive ##ly not only in Ohio and Florida but also in a number of other States and in the overall popular vote .
[unused1] [unused2] Kerry Won the Election by at least 1 ##, ##7 Million V ##otes
[unused1] [unused2] The truth about this election is this : Florida and Ohio had to go for Bush in order for him to ` ##` win ' ##' the election .
[unused1] [unused2] Kerry was the clear winner , but victory was snatched from him .
[unused1] [unused2] Talent was in charge of the CIA when two of the most costly intelligence failures in American history happened - ##- not recognizing the Sept ##. 11 plot , and wrong ##ly claiming that Saddam had a stock ##pile of W ##MD ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in , take over Iraq , and then start moving our troops out rapidly - ##- at this point I think we ' ##re going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade .
[unused1] [unused2] And B ##rem ##er decided to destroy the existing Iraqi army , leaving it up to us and new recruits to try to impose order .
[unused1] [unused2] He was not given very much to work with - ##- Cheney and R ##um ##my are the ones to blame for the screwed up war plans ##- ##of course I am sure they will get their medals too .
[unused1] [unused2] blast at an Iran nuclear facility Iran blame ##s US US breaking news of terrorist attack in near future sounds like some heavy war rhetoric to me .
[unused1] [unused2] I like this quote the best , but I am sure it means nothing to us - ##LR ##B ##- us being the US ' ##s powers that be - ##R ##RB ##- ... ` ##` The Iranian nation is not looking for war , violence and confrontation , ' ##' K ##hat ##ami said .
[unused1] [unused2] so you believe him when he says that i ##ran is n ##' ##t looking for it , but you do n ##' ##t believe the US when we say that we are n ##' ##t ?
[unused1] [unused2] but when you have a sitting president who has an in ##fa ##tu ##ation with pro ##voking other countries into a war , you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove his case against i ##ran .

[unused1] [unused2] In it was a blur ##b reporting that the American Car ##ouse ##l Society had recently disbanded .
[unused1] [unused2] The National Car ##ouse ##l Association was founded in the early 1970 ' ##s by a group of art historians and collectors , including Frederick Fr ##ied , author of the 1964 book ` ##` A Pi ##ctor ##ial History of The Car ##ouse ##l ' ##' that single ##- ##hand ##edly gave the classic hand ##- ##car ##ved wooden car ##ouse ##l the respect and appreciation it deserved .
[unused1] [unused2] S ##wen ##son herself would also leave the NC ##A .
[unused1] [unused2] Meanwhile , those collectors who left the National Car ##ouse ##l Association band ##ed together to form the American Car ##ouse ##l Society - ##LR ##B ##- AC ##S - ##R ##RB ##- , whose stated aims of car ##ouse ##l preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal .
[unused1] [unused2] The mid to late 1990 ' ##s saw the passing of NC ##A founder Fred Fr ##ied , and also that of Charlotte Din ##ger , both who represented the two opposite points of view in the car ##ouse ##l preservation debate .
[unused1] [unused2] There was talk of a - ##LR ##B ##- re - ##R ##RB ##- merger but the regulations governing non ##- ##p ##ro ##fit ##s prevented that .
[unused1] [unused2] Just within the past couple of months though , the American Car ##ouse ##l Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist .

[unused1] [unused2] I saw somewhere on their site there is a lot of pre ##p time needed to get married on ##board .
[unused1] [unused2] going out on the Sen ##sation in March for our 18th an ##ni ##ver ##ary .
[unused1] [unused2] My wife and I were guests at a wedding on the Carnival Legend on New Years Eve 2003 .
[unused1] [unused2] All the guests were folks who had met the bride and groom - ##LR ##B ##- an attractive young couple who were sailing alone - ##R ##RB ##- virtually on cruise ##c ##ritic .
[unused1] [unused2] The wedding took place in the afternoon , before the ship set sail .
[unused1] [unused2] Thus , the couple was actual married by a justice of the peace in the state of Florida .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t know the details , but on my last cruise there was a LA ##R ##GE wedding going on .
[unused1] [unused2] The bride was all deck ##ed out in her long gown and veil , groom in t ##ux and the other wedding party all dressed to the nine ##s !
[unused1] [unused2] I had never heard that announcement before so I assumed that it was for the people attending the wedding on board ?
[unused1] [unused2] This was the largest wedding gathering I have ever seen on board ... maybe someone had connections ? ##? ##?
[unused1] [unused2] The bride was still visible later into the evening still wearing her wedding gown on the Li ##do Deck !
[unused1] [unused2] We renewed our vows on Carnival Conquest on 10 ##/ ##31 ##/ ##20 ##0 ##4 - you need to contact Carnival wedding department and ask if they have any wedding ##/ ##rene ##wal packages available .

[unused1] [unused2] We * just * got back into Washington last evening , after our brief 5 ##- ##day trip to London .
[unused1] [unused2] We got into Heath ##row on Monday morning .
[unused1] [unused2] After that , we took the underground into London .
[unused1] [unused2] Price ##s here were a bit cheaper than the local foods ##tore , and during our trip , I made several trips here : ##- ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] We were n ##' ##t sure what we wanted to eat for dinner , so we just wandered around a bit , and finally ended up at a ` ##` steak ##house ' ##' near the station ... big mistake .
[unused1] [unused2] Too ##k the underground to Victoria , and walked to the Victoria Coach Station - ##LR ##B ##- it ' ##s NO ##T the same : ##- ##R ##RB ##- - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] We also took one of the hop ##- ##on ##/ ##hop ##- ##off bus tours - ##LR ##B ##- the ` ##` Original ' ##' - ##R ##RB ##- on one of the other day , as we thought it was the e ##asi ##est way to get around to the places that we wanted to re ##- ##vis ##it .
[unused1] [unused2] We had been buying the 2 ##- ##zone all ##- ##day tube passes - ##LR ##B ##- 4 ##. ##20 GB ##P each - ##R ##RB ##- everyday , just to get around to dinner and shopping on our own , but by the time this was all over , my wife did n ##' ##t feel like taking the underground back to Heath ##row , so we had asked the hotel con ##ce ##ier ##ge to make a reservation on an airport bus - ##LR ##B ##- 15 GB ##P each - ##R ##RB ##- , but he instead offered that he could get us a private car direct to the airport for 35 GB ##P , which is what we did .
[unused1] [unused2] This was perfect , because it got us door ##- ##to ##- ##do ##or from the hotel to L ##H ##R Terminal 3 with no has ##sle ##s at all .
[unused1] [unused2] I would n ##' ##t have done that from L ##H ##R to the hotel , but since the con ##cier ##ge was arranging it , I felt that it ' ##d be safe , and the driver turned out to be pretty nice .

[unused1] [unused2] You might want to drop off the car somewhere near Red Bank , or as soon as you arrive in New York , if the drop off charges are n ##' ##t too much .
[unused1] [unused2] Then you could take the train or bus back to Boston .
[unused1] [unused2] To put it simply - ##LR ##B ##- for your benefit - ##R ##RB ##- : Lincoln spoke * of * God , demonstrating the irony of a war fought between people with more similarities - ##LR ##B ##- their religious beliefs among them - ##R ##RB ##- than differences .

[unused1] [unused2] Are there minimal requirements before an election can be considered an legitimate election ?
[unused1] [unused2] The recent Iraq election was boycott by the Sunni ##s which constitute about 20 % of the population .
[unused1] [unused2] If so , should that affect the legitimacy of the election ?
[unused1] [unused2] Sunni ##s say Iraq poll illegitimate A leading group of Iraqi Sunni c ##ler ##ics have said the country ' ##s landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunni ##s did not take part in the vote .
[unused1] [unused2] The c ##ler ##ics had encouraged Sunni ##s to boycott the elections because of the presence of US and foreign troops .
[unused1] [unused2] The US and Iraqi authorities , as well as the United Nations , have hailed the election as a ` ##` victory for democracy ' ##' .
[unused1] [unused2] But the Association of Muslim Scholars says any government elected in the poll will not reflect the people ' ##s will .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` These elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of different sect ##s , parties and currents with their influence in Iraq boycott ##ed , ' ##' the association said in a statement .
[unused1] [unused2] I guess l ##tle ##e is an expert on the legitimacy of an election , as the Chinese have so much experience running elections .
[unused1] [unused2] Sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to vote .
[unused1] [unused2] If the Sunni ' ##s were prevented , or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote , then they could claim ill ##eg ##iti ##ma ##cy , but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote , then they declared the vote legitimate of their own vol ##ition while ##st simultaneously c ##eding power to all non ##- ##S ##un ##nis .
[unused1] [unused2] If one slice ##s off one ' ##s nose to spite their face , then nobody should be surprised about their complaints of bleeding .
[unused1] [unused2] You are talking about physically restricted to vote at election day .
[unused1] [unused2] Were they consulted on setting the date of election and how to distribute seats from the votes gain ?
[unused1] [unused2] In addition , they are restricted from moving freely in their own country and ##/ ##or their own city , would that not restricted their election related activities ?
[unused1] [unused2] America invasion , occupation Iraqi ##s are un ##p ##rov ##oked .
[unused1] [unused2] The Sunni ' ##s now claim that the vote is not legitimate because they did n ##' ##t vote .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s not their right to decide the legitimacy of the vote .
[unused1] [unused2] Who do you think the insurgents were killing - ##- s ##hi ##' ##ites .

[unused1] [unused2] Some H ##mon ##g Americans may be re ##int ##roduced to Laos .
[unused1] [unused2] Again , America has LP ##DR under its control , and America can launch airs ##tri ##kes and ground units from Laos .
[unused1] [unused2] Regardless of what happens , the U ##. ##S ##. has a direct ethnic connection to China by way of H ##mon ##g , which will secure CIA ##- ##ins ##urgency operations .
[unused1] [unused2] Unlike the current situation in the Middle ##- ##E ##ast , where the number of Arabic ##- ##sp ##eak ##ing CIA agents are few , there will be plenty of H ##mon ##g ##/ ##C ##hine ##se ##- ##sp ##eak ##ing CIA agents for disposal and use in the looming Sino ##- ##US war .
[unused1] [unused2] Perhaps by route of Thailand , if LP ##DR does not cooperate , the US will in ##cite ins ##ur ##re ##ction in the southern provinces of China .
[unused1] [unused2] This will be the H ##mon ##g ' ##s God ##- ##gi ##ven chance to fight for their own country .

[unused1] [unused2] The electricity that En ##ron produced was so ex ##or ##bit ##ant that the government decided it was cheaper not to buy electricity and pay En ##ron the mandatory fixed charges specified in the contract .

[unused1] [unused2] I actually ca n ##' ##t recall it ever taking 2 weeks to ` ##` count ' ##' these many ballots , generally elections are called within 24 hours .
[unused1] [unused2] What is strange is everyone knows who won , Si ##stan ##i won .
[unused1] [unused2] His party , the major winner , could not field can ##ida ##tes until just before the election , but it was his face on all the poster and his part w ##ip ##ped up the heavily funded US supported government .
[unused1] [unused2] Si ##stan ##i will run Iraq , or the election will be ignored .
[unused1] [unused2] The problem with Si ##stan ##i running Iraq is he refuses to talk to the Am ##ei ##rca ##ns , and as the real power broker what ever figure heads take the PM and other posts will speak with as little authority as their counter parts in Iran .
[unused1] [unused2] The US is now fighting a war for a nation who government they have no direct ties with .
[unused1] [unused2] The other option , and what the US seems to be trying , is to somehow f ##udge the election so Si ##stan ##i does not win , that raise doubts about the outcome , claiming fraud , do anything so that the election causes to results .
[unused1] [unused2] Given the American attention span is about 10 min ##uts the creation of a dictatorship of US puppet ##s against the election would be ignored in the US .
[unused1] [unused2] In the long run I ca n ##' ##t see how Iraq can avoid civil war , since its had it so many times in the past .
[unused1] [unused2] Civil War leading to the victory of one group is the norm in Iraq , and was the ca ##su ##e of most mass graves in the 1980s and 1990s .
[unused1] [unused2] Like ##ly only sanctions have killed more .
[unused1] [unused2] Si ##stan ##i has the popular support and the claim of the election which the Am ##ei ##rca ##ns b ##ung ##led bad ##dly and allowed him to take over .
[unused1] [unused2] Hell when the worst possible event in the election was happening , Si ##stan ##i was flooding the polls with his supporters Bush was crow ##ing .
[unused1] [unused2] So if the US leaves its possible we could see Iraq carved up between the groups .
[unused1] [unused2] As for a civil war , its already started .
[unused1] [unused2] It is pretty bizarre , considering how long they had to organize elections .
[unused1] [unused2] Its not like Germany or Japan where they were so terrified of the Soviets post war that they were happy to see the US stick around .

[unused1] [unused2] Saddam posed a threat to Saudi ##a , Kuwait , and the British oil protector ##ates along the Gulf - that is why we invaded , stupid .
[unused1] [unused2] The truth seems to me that the Israeli government got panicked when Saddam announced that he would reward the families of Palestinian suicide bombers with some 10 thousand dollars .
[unused1] [unused2] Too young to remember the s ##cu ##ds Saddam ' ##s Iraqi Republican Guards lo ##bbed into Israel in 1991 , or 1982 when the Israeli ##s level ##led the Iraqi nuclear weapon facility ?
[unused1] [unused2] Do n ##' ##t even bother asking if this guy remembers the Iraq ##/ ##I ##ran war of 1980 ##- ##19 ##8 ##8 , which when Saddam launched a land / air invasion of Iran .
[unused1] [unused2] Anyone remember K ##hom ##ein ##i ' ##s declaration in 1982 that Iran would n ##' ##t stop fighting until they over ##th ##rew Saddam ?
[unused1] [unused2] How about Saddam ' ##s use of chemical weapons ?
[unused1] [unused2] Re ##cal ##l that we - ##LR ##B ##- and the B ##rits - ##R ##RB ##- involved ourselves in that war ON ##L ##Y in 1987 , after attacks on Kuwait ##i oil tanker ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] How many Iraqi ##s and Iranian ##s were killed in that war ?
[unused1] [unused2] Saddam was so un ##im ##pressed by Iraqi casualties , he invaded Kuwait barely two years after the UN ##- ##im ##posed cease ##fire .
[unused1] [unused2] I hear discussion along the lines that the United States was * wanting * to go to war with Japan , and had been trying to bring that about for years .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##ve read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid , or at the very least post ##po ##ne , a war against Japan , mainly because F ##DR was trying to pro ##voke Hitler to war and did n ##' ##t need a distraction on another distant front .
[unused1] [unused2] The thesis has been ex ##po ##und ##ed by several conspiracy theorist ##s , mainly the ones who ex ##po ##und ##ed that F ##DR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked , and let it happen .
[unused1] [unused2] One of their ` ##` proof ##s ' ##' was that the US carriers were out of port during the attack , and ` ##` everybody knew ' ##' carriers were the capital ship of the future .
[unused1] [unused2] However , the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort , on possibly inter ##sect ##ing routes with the I ##J ##N Kid ##o But ##ai , which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort .
[unused1] [unused2] Consequently , for the P ##H conspiracy theorist ##s to believe that F ##DR kept the carriers out of harm ' ##s way , we not only have to grant F ##DR the full knowledge of Kid ##o But ##ai ' ##s route of approach would not result in either US ##N carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle , but that F ##DR could psychic ##ally manipulate the weather to prevent Hal ##sey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed .
[unused1] [unused2] To make a very long story short , it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941 , considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war , and the overwhelming lack of evidence - ##LR ##B ##- not to mention rational thought - ##R ##RB ##- arguing for a US desire for war .
[unused1] [unused2] Was n ##' ##t Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US ?
[unused1] [unused2] This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being ` ##` driven into a corner ' ##' by sanctions , and had no choice but to attack the US .
[unused1] [unused2] However , after World War I , Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former Imperial partners ; they began a long , slow process of di ##sen ##ga ##ging themselves from their former Imperial areas , from their colonies , in addition to outright stopping all expansion ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] With the deaths of many of the ideal ##istic leaders who had led Japan ' ##s rise to international prominence , and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs , in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the strip ##ping of possessions from Germany , Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area .
[unused1] [unused2] This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan ' ##s invasion of China proper in 1936 .
[unused1] [unused2] It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in ` ##` 3 to 6 months ' ##' ; at the time of Pearl Harbor , it had been going on for 5 years , at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives .
[unused1] [unused2] The war put a tremendous strain on Japan - ##LR ##B ##- and was in fact opposed by more radical ##ly N ##AT ##ION ##AL ##IS ##TI ##C elements , as taking away from the development of Japan ' ##s other possessions , particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel . - ##R ##RB ##-
[unused1] [unused2] Domestic consumption fell , consumer goods became scarce , and the use of material ##e for war purposes ate into Japan ' ##s domestic industry .
[unused1] [unused2] The war effort took on a life of its own , however , and common sense was subordinate ##d to it .
[unused1] [unused2] Japan expanded into areas of China and Indo ##china which had no strategic value to her , but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area ; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler .
[unused1] [unused2] While Japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF THE WA ##R IN CH ##IN ##A ST ##OP ##P ##ED , they were power ##less over the military they were supposed to control .
[unused1] [unused2] An a ##bor ##tive attack on Soviet positions in Mongolia had placed Japan ' ##s focus firmly south , towards the possessions of the US ' future allies .
[unused1] [unused2] For no reason anyone could art ##iculate , Japan felt she had to continue the war in China .
[unused1] [unused2] To continue the war in China , she had to have resources of oil and metal .
[unused1] [unused2] To have these resources , she must seize them , if others refused to sell them .
[unused1] [unused2] In order to seize them , she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US .
[unused1] [unused2] Thus , for a ` ##` 3 to 6 month ' ##' operation in China in 1937 , Japan would em ##bark on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries she had acquired in 70 years .

[unused1] [unused2] Lincoln won a plural ##ity with about 40 % of the vote .
[unused1] [unused2] I believe Douglas would have won .
[unused1] [unused2] This would have delayed se ##cession and the Civil War .
[unused1] [unused2] See for a confirmation of the electoral arithmetic : the states where Lincoln got an a ##bol ##ute majority of the popular vote - ##LR ##B ##- i ##. ##e ##. , all the free states except Oregon , California , and New Jersey - ##R ##RB ##- were sufficient to bring him a majority in the Electoral College .
[unused1] [unused2] The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer ` ##` wasted ' ##' votes than his opponents - ##- in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all .
[unused1] [unused2] Whether it was Lincoln vs ##. Douglas or Lincoln vs ##. Fusion Can ##di ##date , would n ##' ##t a candidate having won the Electoral College vote with only 40 % of the popular vote have provoked protests any ##how ?

[unused1] [unused2] Yet again I notice that the media see gay ##s as ` invisible ' when it comes to Holocaust Day .
[unused1] [unused2] This morning , when talking about the horror ##s of Au ##s ##witch on the BBC Breakfast programme , they referred to the slaughter of thousands of Jews and others .
[unused1] [unused2] You would n ##' ##t know anything about the slaughter of gay ##s if you only listened to the BBC .
[unused1] [unused2] I have just - ##LR ##B ##- in the last 1 ##/ ##2 hour - ##R ##RB ##- heard Radio Wales refer to the millions of Jews and other minor ##ites including G ##y ##ps ##ies and homosexual ##s who died in the concentration camps .
[unused1] [unused2] As mentioned in ` ##` The Final Sol ##ution ' ##' thread , the number of men killed for being homosexual was at the most 10 ##- ##15 , ##00 ##0 .
[unused1] [unused2] Now that ' ##s significant , but compared to the genocide of Jews and Z ##ige ##une ##r it ' ##s not as significant - ##LR ##B ##- though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] I was watching the BBC news this morning and they interviewed the man who is going to be in charge of Holocaust Day , certainly in the future .
[unused1] [unused2] This is a bit like rating Stalin and Hitler for bad ##ness purely on the grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s ` ##` significant ' ##' if any group of people is identified for liquid ##ation by the government of the country in which they live , surely ?
[unused1] [unused2] I did get an email back from the BBC saying that they understood what I was saying and would try to be more inclusive .
[unused1] [unused2] The Holocaust of the Jews and Z ##ige ##une ##r was motivated by racial prejudice ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] The murder of - ##LR ##B ##- at the most - ##R ##RB ##- 10 ##k homosexual ##s was n ##' ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] Most homosexual ##s arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jail ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] The Jews and Z ##ige ##une ##r on the other hand were killed simply for their onto ##logical state .
[unused1] [unused2] Once again , I ' ##m not dim ##ini ##shing the horror of any individual murder , just trying to get it into perspective .
[unused1] [unused2] I think the chance of their being only 1000 ##0 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small .
[unused1] [unused2] Records appear to show that 5000 ##0 _ men _ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule , finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jail ##s were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence , but 10 ##- ##15 ##k seems reasonable
[unused1] [unused2] On Saturday we hosted what was for the most part a largely successful Halloween party - ##- save for the fake blood stain ##s on the carpet and bathroom walls , a couple beer spill ##s , unnecessary fights and the expected trash ##ing of the kitchen and living room areas .
[unused1] [unused2] Al ##as , too little too late was the case thanks to the in ##ept Wyatt Sex ##ton who has been our starter since replacing R ##ix earlier in the season .
[unused1] [unused2] I wish I could have been at a Pub , or wherever these people con ##ven ##e , to see the reactions from all the B ##rito ##ns who read the Telegraph this morning - ##LR ##B ##- emphasis added - ##R ##RB ##- : Britain ' ##s gun laws are aimed at the wrong target , curb ##ing and criminal ##ising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years , according to an international firearms legislation expert .
[unused1] [unused2] Prof Gary Ma ##user said that Britain was making the same mistake as Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law ##- ##abi ##ding community where gun crimes , such as the Du ##n ##bla ##ne massacre , were a ##ber ##rations .
[unused1] [unused2] His warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day in England and Wales , more than twice the level of when the Labour Government came to power in 1997 .
[unused1] [unused2] In the past two years , there have been cases of school ##child ##ren and a baby , killed or injured by guns .
[unused1] [unused2] Prof Ma ##user added : ` ##` The sad truth is that while the police officers are inspect ##ing farmers ' gun cabinets to see if they comply with regulations somewhere in the UK , someone , who has not filled in a firearms certificate form , will be smuggling a gun into the country or selling one to an inner city youth . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] More than a few e ##- ##mail ##s have come in wondering why I have n ##' ##t remarked on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov ##. 21 that left six people dead , and why I have n ##' ##t updated the AS ##SA ##U ##LT W ##EA ##PO ##NS BA ##N CO ##UN ##TE ##R .
[unused1] [unused2] But as for the assault weapons ban issue , the man accused of the brutal killings , Cha ##i Van ##g of St ##. Paul , Min ##n , used a Russian ##- ##bu ##ilt Sai ##ga 7 ##. ##6 ##2 mm , SK ##S semi ##aut ##oma ##tic rifle .
[unused1] [unused2] The ban expired in September and at the time of this posting , no one has been killed by any one of those weapons since the ban expired .
[unused1] [unused2] But let ' ##s talk about this case , as I ' ##m sure discussions have started and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident .
[unused1] [unused2] While the media use words like ` ##` military style , ' ##' ` ##` assault ' ##' and ` ##` semi ##aut ##oma ##tic , ' ##' the gun used in the s ##lay ##ings was not unlike a typical hunting rifle .
[unused1] [unused2] If convicted of the killings , Van ##g faces life in prison as Minnesota does not honor the death penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] I look forward to Van ##g ' ##s conviction and I pray for the families of the victims .
[unused1] [unused2] What happened was in ##de ##fen ##sible and justice must be served .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The day the Nazis came to the hospital , someone came to our room and said : ` You have to cough , you have to cough a lot because they are afraid of the coughing , they do n ##' ##t want to catch an awful disease and they w ##o n ##' ##t enter ' . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Defense Secretary Donald R ##ums ##feld took part in a Q ##& ##A with the troops today that was anything but co ##zy .
[unused1] [unused2] From the Associated Press : ` ##` You go to war with the Army you have , ' ##' R ##ums ##feld replied , ` ##` not the Army you might want or wish to have . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Wilson , an airplane mechanic whose unit , the 278 ##th Regiment ##al Combat Team of the Tennessee Army National Guard , is about to drive north into Iraq for a one ##- ##ye ##ar tour of duty , put his finger on a problem that has bed ##ev ##iled the Pentagon for more than a year .
[unused1] [unused2] R ##ums ##feld said the Army was spa ##ring no expense or effort to acquire as many Hu ##m ##ve ##es and other vehicles with extra armor as it can .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can - ##LR ##B ##- still - ##R ##RB ##- be blown up , ' ##' he said .
[unused1] [unused2] However , it ' ##s the murder capital of the United States , ' ##' he said .
[unused1] [unused2] From the Associated Press : A baby girl who had been cut out of her mother ' ##s w ##omb was found after a frantic search , and authorities arrested the woman they say strangled the mother and stole the child .
[unused1] [unused2] Lisa M ##. Montgomery , 36 , of Mel ##vern , Ka ##n ##. , was arrested later Friday and charged with kidnapping resulting in death .
[unused1] [unused2] St ##inn ##ett , who was eight months pregnant , had earlier been talking with her mother on the phone , and hung up saying a woman she had chat ##ted with online had just arrived at her door , authorities said .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. Attorney Todd Graves said Montgomery contacted St ##inn ##ett through an online message board , and authorities zero ##ed in on her using computer forensic ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] According to the criminal complaint , Montgomery traveled about 40 miles to Top ##eka , Ka ##n ##. , on Thursday to go shopping .
[unused1] [unused2] Her husband received a call from her saying she had gone into labor and given birth .
[unused1] [unused2] The next day , authorities say , Montgomery confessed that she strangled St ##inn ##ett from behind , cut her open , removed the baby and cut her um ##bil ##ical cord .
[unused1] [unused2] I do n ##' ##t understand how we can call this f ##etus ##- ##thing that was ripped from a mother ' ##s w ##omb a ` ##` child ' ##' or ` ##` girl ' ##' in a society that sanctions partial ##- ##birth abortion .
[unused1] [unused2] If you ca n ##' ##t charge someone for killing a f ##etus via abortion during the eighth month , then surely you ca n ##' ##t make a big deal about a woman who kidnapped a f ##etus that survived the kn ##if ##ing .
[unused1] [unused2] No one should have to die because some crazy nut wanted a child and decided to kill for it .
[unused1] [unused2] Question for the pro ##- ##cho ##ice ##rs : Being that it is n ##' ##t yet the ninth month , can we still charge the killer with kidnapping ?
[unused1] [unused2] Of course , I ' ##m sure the Democrats would also like to start winning elections again .
[unused1] [unused2] The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the Democratic National , particularly between two leading candidates : former Vermont Go ##v ##.
[unused1] [unused2] Howard Dean , who supports abortion rights , and former Indiana Rep ##. Tim Roe ##mer , an abortion foe who argues that the party can not re ##bound from its losses in the November election unless it shows more tolerance on one of society ' ##s most emotional conflicts .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course outspoken organizations such as Plan ##ned Pa ##rent ##hood , which gives a lot of money to Democrats , will fight with everything they ' ##ve got to keep the Democratic platform as liberal as possible .
[unused1] [unused2] Results from the last few elections suggest that would n ##' ##t be such a good idea if they ever want to gain more power in Congress .
[unused1] [unused2] On a much sad ##der note , the Minister of Defense , Reggie White , died of heart attack this morning in his home at the age of 43 .
[unused1] [unused2] He retired after the 2000 season as the NFL ' ##s all ##- ##time leader in sacks with 198 .
[unused1] [unused2] Fe ##mini ##sts have a reason to celebrate today as an appeals court just threw out the convictions of their martyr , Andrea Yates , by ruling that one of the prosecutor ' ##s expert witnesses gave false testimony at her trial .
[unused1] [unused2] Yates , in case you have forgotten , is the women from Texas who he ##ino ##us ##ly drowned her five kids , aged 6 months to 7 years , one by one , in her bath ##tub .
[unused1] [unused2] Liberal feminist organizations rushed to Yates ' defense , most notably the National Organization for Women , which provided money for her defense fund and held candle ##light v ##igi ##ls .
[unused1] [unused2] No such ceremonies were held for her five dead children .
[unused1] [unused2] In 2002 a jury sentenced Yates to life in prison for the deaths of three of her children .
[unused1] [unused2] She was not tried in the deaths of the other two .
[unused1] [unused2] Today the 1st Court of Appeals overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial .
[unused1] [unused2] The blood red nation of China is trying to curb the effects of a devastating 20 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old policy that out ##law ##ed women from having more than one child .
[unused1] [unused2] As a result , only about 100 girls are born for every 119 boys , because couples traditionally favor males .
[unused1] [unused2] So now by killing the males they can hopefully narrow the gender gap .
[unused1] [unused2] One such activist is Mao He ##ng ##feng , who was dismissed in 1988 from her job at a Shanghai soap factory after becoming pregnant a second time .
[unused1] [unused2] Last April , the Shanghai public security bureau sentenced her to 18 months in a labor camp for campaigning against the one ##- ##child policy .
[unused1] [unused2] In a ho ##rri ##bly de ##ce ##it ##ful manner , the Brady Campaign has released ` ##` report cards ' ##' for every state on their gun laws that supposedly shield children from gun violence .
[unused1] [unused2] The FDA may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores can sell the emergency con ##tra ##ception known as Plan B without a prescription to women age 16 and older .

[unused1] [unused2] Taylor O ##ster ##gaard , then 17 , and Lindsey Jo Z ##elli ##tte , 18 , paid the judgment on Thursday after a small claims court ruling by La Plata County Court Judge Doug Walker , a court clerk said on Friday .
[unused1] [unused2] The Denver Post newspaper reported on Friday that the girls had decided to stay home and b ##ake the cookies rather than go to a dance where there might be cursing and drinking .
[unused1] [unused2] Yes , only the Christians value life when it ' ##s a life before birth .

[unused1] [unused2] From the Associated Press : A lone gun ##man opened fire with an assault rifle Sunday inside a crowded mall in ups ##tate New York , wound ##ing one person before running out of ammunition and being subdued by employees , authorities said .
[unused1] [unused2] The gun ##man began shooting inside the Hudson Valley Mall shortly after 3 p ##. ##m ##. in Kingston , nearly 90 miles north of New York City .
[unused1] [unused2] The 24 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old gun ##man went into a Best Buy store and started firing .
[unused1] [unused2] You ' ##re telling me someone was able to take an AK ##- ##47 ` ##` assault rifle ' ##' into a mall and in ##jure people ? ##!
[unused1] [unused2] And because New York has such strict gun laws - meaning citizens are prohibited from conceal ##ing weapons - a gun ##ner can use bag ##- ##to ##ting shop ##pers as target practice because guns laws keep mall shop ##pers at his mercy .
[unused1] [unused2] Had an armed civilian been inside the mall , perhaps he could have intervened before the suspect began injuring people before he ran out of am ##mo .
[unused1] [unused2] From the St ##. Pete Times : Some Florida legislators want to give people the right to shoot an attacker in a public place .
[unused1] [unused2] A House committee voted Wednesday to allow people to shoot to kill in self ##- ##de ##fen ##se if they are attacked ` ##` in any other place where he or she has a right to be . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] State law defines deadly force as that which is likely to cause ` ##` death or great bodily harm , ' ##' such as firing a gun at a person or a vehicle .
[unused1] [unused2] Florida courts consider deadly force a last resort and have held that a person being attacked has the ` ##` duty to use every reasonable means to avoid the danger , including retreat , prior to using deadly force . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] But this legislation says a person who is under attack in a public place ` ##` has no duty to retreat . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Law ##- ##abi ##ding people should not be told that if they are attacked , they should turn around and run , ' ##' N ##RA lobby ##ist Marion Hammer told law ##makers .
[unused1] [unused2] Ba ##xley held up a stack of more than 800 e ##- ##mail ##s from F ##lor ##idian ##s who he said have written him to support the bill .
[unused1] [unused2] Currently , if one ' ##s life is threatened he ##/ ##she must make sure it is impossible to escape before using deadly force on an attacker .
[unused1] [unused2] 164 days after the ex ##piration of the federal ` ##` assault weapons ' ##' ban some l ##una ##tic opened fire with an AK ##- ##47 outside a Texas courthouse .
[unused1] [unused2] A brave civilian with a concealed weapons permit tried to stop him but was gun ##ned down by David Hernandez Arroyo Sr , the s ##cum ##bag who happened to be wearing body armor at the time and who also took out his ex ##- ##wife over a child support dispute .
[unused1] [unused2] I would n ##' ##t be surprised if this Arroyo character - ##LR ##B ##- who was killed by police as he tried to flee - ##R ##RB ##- had a serious criminal past but has been allowed to walk free due to our la ##x judicial process .

[unused1] [unused2] MA ##G : Ara ##fa ##t Ski ##mme ##d $ 2 Million a Month From the Gas Trade Sun Nov 14 2004 09 ##: ##53 ##: ##40 ET ##N ##ew York
[unused1] [unused2] - ##- Last year audit ##ors discovered Ara ##fa ##t was guilty of ski ##mming $ 2 million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories , T ##IM ##E reports ##. ##I ##n August 2002 international donors forced Ara ##fa ##t to sign over his investments to the Palestine Investment Fund , which was audit ##ed by U ##. ##S ##. accountant ##s and managed by Palestinian Finance Minister Sal ##am Fay ##ya ##d , a former International Mon ##eta ##ry Fund official .
[unused1] [unused2] People close to Fay ##ya ##d ' ##s investigation told T ##IM ##E of Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s ski ##mming from the gas trade .
[unused1] [unused2] Breaking the gasoline smuggling and corruption boost ##ed the Palestinian Authority ' ##s official treasury by $ 10 million a month and cut gas prices for ordinary Palestinians .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s death means his followers may never know just how much more they may be owed , ` ##` writes T ##IM ##E ' ##s Matt Rees in ` ##` Where ' ##s Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s Money ? ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] By the time of his death , he was down to his last $ 1 billion , according to Israeli ##- ##int ##elli ##gence estimates ##. ##A ##ra ##fa ##t wife Su ##ha ' ##s out ##burst that his successors were ` ##` trying to bury - ##LS ##B ##- him - ##RS ##B ##- alive ' ##' came after she learned that Ara ##fa ##t had signed over at least $ 800 million to the government of the Palestinian Authority two years ago , T ##IM ##E reports .
[unused1] [unused2] Top Palestinian officials say Su ##ha wants the new chief of the P ##. ##L ##. ##O ##. , Ma ##hm ##oud Abbas , and Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qur ##ei to give her money out of the P ##. ##L ##. ##O ##.
[unused1] [unused2] official tells T ##IM ##E , ` ##` they ' ##ll pay her a pension , and that ' ##s it . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] People familiar with Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s finances say the Palestinian leader sent Su ##ha $ 200 ##, ##00 ##0 a month out of the Palestinian Authority ' ##s budget for the Office of the President .
[unused1] [unused2] French authorities are investigating transfers of $ 15 million from Swiss banks to Paris accounts in Su ##ha ' ##s name at the Arab Bank and at B ##NP Pa ##ri ##bas Bank , a French bank , T ##IM ##E reports ##. ##S ##eni ##or Palestinian security officials tell T ##IM ##E that Ara ##fa ##t also shipped money to the gun ##men of the A ##q ##sa Marty ##rs Brigade ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Time is reporting today that a al ##- ##Q ##ae ##da operative was captured and is spit ##ting out that they have plans in the work to smug ##gle n ##uke ##s into the US from Mexico , see the article here .
[unused1] [unused2] This policy would just make it easier for the enemy to get within our borders .
[unused1] [unused2] Just reported from AP that Con ##di Rice has been chosen by President Bush to become the new Secretary of State for his second term .
[unused1] [unused2] Apparently James Baker , former Secretary of State and current en ##voy for the Bush Administration , has asked the Is ##real ##i government to release a s ##cum ##bag terrorist to promote ` ##` peace ' ##' .
[unused1] [unused2] Here are some of the fine achievements of the terrorist Mar ##wan Bar ##gh ##out ##i Mar ##wan Bar ##gh ##out ##i - ##LR ##B ##- born June 6 , 1958 - ##R ##RB ##- is a Palestinian leader from the West Bank and a leader of the Fat ##ah movement that forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization - ##LR ##B ##- P ##L ##O - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] On June 6 , 2004 , he was sentenced to five life sentences for five murders of Israeli civilians and 40 years imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians .
[unused1] [unused2] Bar ##gh ##out ##i was one of the major leaders of the First In ##ti ##fa ##da in 1987 , leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank .
[unused1] [unused2] During the uprising , he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan , where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo A ##cco ##rds in 1994 .
[unused1] [unused2] In 1996 , he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council , in which he advocated peace with Israel , sometimes coming in conflict with Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] By the summer of 2000 , Bar ##gh ##out ##i and Ara ##fa ##t had grown increasingly at odds with each other , with Bar ##gh ##out ##i accusing Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations , and Ara ##fa ##t was planning to fire him shortly .
[unused1] [unused2] However , as the Second In ##ti ##fa ##da began , Bar ##gh ##out ##i became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fat ##ah Tan ##zi ##m militia .
[unused1] [unused2] This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tan ##zi ##m into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Ji ##had , responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive ##- ##by shooting ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Under Bar ##gh ##out ##i , the Tan ##zi ##m has also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al ##- ##A ##q ##sa Marty ##rs ' Brigade ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Release a known terrorist to run the P ##L ##O and that will bring about peace , give me a e ##ffin break
[unused1] [unused2] On Sunday he wrote of two Iraqi soldiers who did n ##' ##t see us as conquer ##ors but as allies when the Mo ##sul bombing occurred .
[unused1] [unused2] One piece of s ##hra ##p ##nel sliced through the f ##em ##oral artery of a U ##. ##S ##. soldier and his only chance for survival was in the hands of these two Iraqi ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] They moved the soldier to a ME ##D ##VA ##C vehicle via two ##- ##man litter carry .
[unused1] [unused2] After they ho ##isted the soldier in the truck , the two Iraqi ##s - ##- one an officer , the other an NC ##O - ##- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety .
[unused1] [unused2] When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated , everybody who could talk was questioned about their health .
[unused1] [unused2] When the me ##dic ##s came to the two Iraqi ##s , the IN ##G soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was .
[unused1] [unused2] No matter what the MS ##M tries to tell you , there are Iraqi ' ##s who will help the allies , who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their country .
[unused1] [unused2] This brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while visiting Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] And I will also say this to you : There are people dying in Iraq , but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the in ##ti ##mi ##dation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better .
[unused1] [unused2] a lot of them are n ##' ##t living in the Green Zone , they ' ##ve got to travel in from outside .
[unused1] [unused2] They do not know at any point in time whether they ' ##re going to be subject to brutality or in ##ti ##mi ##dation , even death , and yet they carry on doing it .
[unused1] [unused2] The FBI , concerned that terrorists could use laser ##s as weapons , is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpit ##s of seven airplane ##s in flight since Christmas .
[unused1] [unused2] Las ##er beams can temporarily blind or di ##sor ##ient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash .
[unused1] [unused2] The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs , Col ##o ##. , and one each in Cleveland , Washington , Houston , Te ##ter ##boro , N ##. ##J ##. , and Me ##dford , Or ##e ##. , according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials , some of whom spoke only on condition of an ##ony ##mity .
[unused1] [unused2] A federal law enforcement official , who declined to be identified by name , said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity .
[unused1] [unused2] But pilots are troubled by the incidents , and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` That ' ##s not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents , ' ##' Thompson said .
[unused1] [unused2] Michelle Mal ##kin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling laser ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] This Is n ##' ##t Writing , It ' ##s Ty ##ping has a great post out with a ton of info , some of it quite scary A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese ##- ##p ##roduced Z ##M ##- ##8 ##7 laser blind ##er which is specifically designed to blind eyes ##ight .
[unused1] [unused2] The Japanese terrorist cult Au ##m Shin ##rik ##yo - ##- which launched the infamous Sa ##rin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995 - ##- was discovered to have experimented with the use of laser ##s as weapons ##. ##A ##cco ##rdi ##ng to The Asian Pacific Post , ` ##` C ##ult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck .
[unused1] [unused2] They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen , but the plan failed when the laser ma ##lf ##un ##ction ##ed during the testing stage . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched miss ##le threat to airline ##rs , which this might very well be a precursor to : Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface ##- ##to ##- ##air missiles - ##LR ##B ##- SA ##Ms - ##R ##RB ##- , referred to as Man ##- ##P ##ort ##able Air Defense Systems - ##LR ##B ##- MA ##NP ##AD ##S - ##R ##RB ##- , pose to commercial airline ##rs .
[unused1] [unused2] Pro ##cedural improvements such as specific flight crew training , altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat , and improved security near airports may be less costly than counter ##me ##asures and could more immediately help de ##ter domestic terrorist attacks .
[unused1] [unused2] However , these techniques by themselves can not completely mit ##igate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U ##. ##S ##. airline ##rs flying to and from foreign airports .
[unused1] [unused2] While this legislation is still under consideration , Homeland Security app ##ropriations designated $ 60 million in F ##Y ##20 ##0 ##4 and $ 61 million in F ##Y ##20 ##0 ##5 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile counter ##me ##as ##ure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology .
[unused1] [unused2] One is the death of Ya ##sser Ara ##fa ##t .
[unused1] [unused2] But since Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s death , Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground : supporting Ariel Sharon ' ##s withdrawal from Gaza , putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and , covert ##ly , backing Ma ##hm ##oud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader .
[unused1] [unused2] A second reason is Europe ' ##s growing worries about Islamic terrorism .
[unused1] [unused2] The murder in November of Theo van Go ##gh , a pro ##vocative Dutch filmmaker , at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe ' ##s 9 ##/ ##11 .
[unused1] [unused2] The Ukrainian election - ##- complete with its K ##GB ##- ##style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy ##- ##hand ##ed electoral fraud - ##- has reminded European diplomat ##s of Vladimir V ##. Putin ' ##s determination to control his ` ##` near abroad . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] His thump ##ing re ##- ##ele ##ction , however , shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion .
[unused1] [unused2] Nicola ##e Mi ##sch ##ie , author ##itarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party , has been jailed .
[unused1] [unused2] Romania voted in the last December , ou ##sting the so ##- ##cal ##led socialist party PS ##D - ##LR ##B ##- Social ##- ##D ##em ##oc ##ratic Party - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mi ##sch ##ie bought the house where his paper ' ##s subject lived .
[unused1] [unused2] Local leaders did their jobs , but national leaders , press ##uring TV stations to lie , ass ##oc ##iating with old communist ex ##- ##p ##res ##iden ##t Ion Il ##ies ##cu , failed to win in big cities .
[unused1] [unused2] PS ##D is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader .
[unused1] [unused2] It is known that communist leaders die in office - ##LR ##B ##- as judges of the U ##. ##S ##. Supreme Court - ##R ##RB ##- and Ion Il ##ies ##cu w ##o n ##' ##t be different .
[unused1] [unused2] Mi ##sch ##ie was right to critic ##ize the national leaders , because PS ##D got a good share in the elections in his area .
[unused1] [unused2] Suicide bombings and guerrilla attacks carried out by insurgents and foreign terrorists based around Baghdad have es ##calated to alarm ##ing levels particularly during Rama ##dan .
[unused1] [unused2] Deputy governor of Di ##yal ##a along with several council members from Ba ` q ##uba were ambushed and killed in La ##ti ##fi ##ya south of Baghdad , an area which has supposedly been ` cleared ' from insurgents a couple of weeks ago .
[unused1] [unused2] Four suicide attacks in Sam ##arra , also a recently ` liberated ' area , against National Guard units and the governor ##ate building .
[unused1] [unused2] Z ##ar ##qa ##wi ' ##s group claimed responsibility for the attacks .
[unused1] [unused2] Three police stations in Had ##ith ##a , a small town west of Rama ##di , were assaulted by groups of insurgents .
[unused1] [unused2] Some 30 policemen were captured , tied up and executed in cold blood against the walls following a confrontation which lasted two hours .
[unused1] [unused2] - I ##mme ##dia ##te withdrawal of US and Iraqi security forces from the An ##bar governor ##ate and the hand ##over of security responsibilities to former army officers from An ##bar .
[unused1] [unused2] - The removal of certain officials - ##LR ##B ##- most of them from Shi ##' ##ite Islamic parties such as Ibrahim Al ##- ##J ##a ` far ##i - ##R ##RB ##- from governmental positions .
[unused1] [unused2] - The complete return of Ba ##' ##ath ##ists , army officers , Republican Guards , Mu ##kha ##bara ##t , intelligence and security personnel to their former positions .
[unused1] [unused2] Side ##note : Mu ##' ##aw ##iya bin A ##bi Su ##fy ##an was the governor of Syria during the 7th century and he fought Imam Ali bin A ##bi Ta ##li ##b - ##LR ##B ##- Mu ##ham ##med ' ##s son ##- ##in ##- ##law - ##R ##RB ##- over the Cal ##ip ##hat ##e after the assassination of Cal ##ip ##h O ##th ##man .
[unused1] [unused2] He became the first Um ##ma ##yi ##d Cal ##ip ##h and two decades later , under the Cal ##ip ##hat ##e of his son Ya ##zi ##d , Imam Hussein bin Ali - ##LR ##B ##- grandson of Mu ##ham ##med - ##R ##RB ##- was killed by his armies at present day Ka ##rb ##ala .
[unused1] [unused2] Refuge ##es have been pouring out of Fall ##u ##jah over the last few days into Baghdad and the surrounding areas .
[unused1] [unused2] Refuge ##es in Baghdad have confirmed the rumours that the ` Mu ##jah ##ide ##en ' are forcing men from 15 ##- ##50 years old to stay and that they were threatened with execution if they refuse to carry arms in defense of the town .
[unused1] [unused2] Maj ##lis Shu ##ra Al ##- ##M ##u ##jah ##ide ##en - ##LR ##B ##- The Mu ##jah ##ide ##en Advisory Council - ##R ##RB ##- are in control of Fall ##u ##jah and they have distributed a statement inviting Arab and foreign - ##LR ##B ##- including American - ##R ##RB ##- media reporters to enter the town and cover the battles .
[unused1] [unused2] Everyone is closely watching what the next few days will bring , hoping the violence does n ##' ##t spread to the streets of Baghdad or other areas .
[unused1] [unused2] I am tired , hungry , and I leave for work and get home from work in the dark .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , if you ' ##ll excuse me , I have to go stalk the lobby for the girls that are bringing me my K ##ry ##stal ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s now just one day until I hop in the car and head back in time to the love ##liest village on the Plains ... Auburn , Alabama .
[unused1] [unused2] Can someone tell me why one of my friends or family members has n ##' ##t smacked me because of it ?
[unused1] [unused2] It seems that in recent years , instead of doing the people ' ##s business , good o ##le Linda has spent her time stealing over 600 grand in Federal Education funds .
[unused1] [unused2] One thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her indictment in a fur coat .
[unused1] [unused2] Um ##mm , am I the only one that learned anything from the Michael I ##rvin drug trial of the mid 90 ' ##s ?
[unused1] [unused2] You never E ##VE ##R show up at court , especially facing indictment for stealing large sums of money , wearing a fucking F ##UR CO ##AT ! ##!
[unused1] [unused2] Sc ##hren ##ko is a s ##cum ##bag and , although she w ##o n ##' ##t get any actual jail time , I hope the fine she plea ##ds to is at least as much as what she stole .
[unused1] [unused2] Remember when Michael Milk ##en got bust ##ed , he was not forced to give up his secret accounts , and when the fine of 600 million was le ##vied ... H ##E PA ##ID IT ! ##!
[unused1] [unused2] Sc ##hren ##ko stole 20 times what Martha Stewart did , and I bet she w ##o n ##' ##t see the wrong side of a jail cell door , and that ' ##s sad .
[unused1] [unused2] This is n ##' ##t a football game , and it ' ##s not two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion .
[unused1] [unused2] I want to know where the Federal criminal charges against all parties involved are .
[unused1] [unused2] A year ago , the program was in di ##sar ##ray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over ##- ##ze ##alo ##us and too em ##powered boost ##er with a fat check ##book .
[unused1] [unused2] This despite several late hits to the head , low hits at his knees and ankles , and various other assaults outside the realm of good sports ##manship .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m reading ESPN this morning when I stumbled across the story where Kobe Bryant said he ' ##d like to sit down with S ##ha ##q and apologize to him for ` ##` involving him in my troubles . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] So he told the media that he should have done what S ##ha ##q always did , just pay the women to shut up .
[unused1] [unused2] Kobe also alleged that O ##' ##nea ##l had paid upwards of one million dollars in this way as h ##ush money over the years .
[unused1] [unused2] He found the lane to the farm and drove up into the farm ##yard , where he was met by the farmer .
[unused1] [unused2] Coming from the other direction , Jacksonville DB Don ##ov ##in Darius un ##loaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothes ##line .
[unused1] [unused2] After many minutes lying motionless on the field , Ferguson was finally removed via stretch ##er , giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out .
[unused1] [unused2] This was not one of the staged stiff ##- ##arm ##ed clothes ##lines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts .
[unused1] [unused2] This was a vicious , arm cocked and swinging clothes ##line that literally could have torn Ferguson ' ##s head off of his body .
[unused1] [unused2] One side ##note here is that , despite their r ##abi ##d fan ##dom and the situation , not one thing was thrown at the off ##ending player as he left the field .
[unused1] [unused2] This was the most vicious and b ##lat ##antly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80 ' ##s about five seconds after he had released a pass .
[unused1] [unused2] Darius ' intent was to di ##sm ##em ##ber , in ##jure or even kill Ferguson .
[unused1] [unused2] In this day and age of bigger , stronger and faster players , injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time .
[unused1] [unused2] There is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson ' ##s injury .
[unused1] [unused2] Paul Tag ##lia ##bu ##e must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerate ##d .
[unused1] [unused2] If not , I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle this matter ` ##` on the field ' ##' with Darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive line ##man .
[unused1] [unused2] I am happy she left the note and took responsibility for it , but what in the fuck is going on that every couple of months I ' ##m taking cars to the shop for things that are not my fault ?
[unused1] [unused2] I will return this piece of shit on Friday , only to rent another vehicle Monday morning while we take the wife ' ##s car to the shop to get her 1400 bucks worth of damage repaired .
[unused1] [unused2] I plan to call her this morning and tell her the total , complete with my rental car for a week .
[unused1] [unused2] A year ago , Tu ##ber ##ville was one reporter ' ##s a ##bil ##ilt ##y to find an out of place airplane in Ohio away from being fired B ##EF ##OR ##E the Alabama game .
[unused1] [unused2] Then , the AD and President get can ##ned , a boost ##er starts down the long road to s ##hun ##- ##ville , and Tu ##ber ##ville keeps smiling and saying the right things .
[unused1] [unused2] He talks his two running backs and two stellar DB ' ##s into staying , then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron ##- ##c ##lad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years , and if Auburn even thinks ... T ##H ##IN ##KS about letting him go , they owe him every penny .
[unused1] [unused2] He could have sex with an endangered Ba ##ld Eagle , and they ' ##d ST ##IL ##L have to pay him .
[unused1] [unused2] Much like the ` ##` I told you so ' ##s ' ##' everyone is throwing at the U ##GA basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of The Ha ##rrick ##s , folks around the Buck ##eye state have to be having similar thoughts .
[unused1] [unused2] It seems that AD and frequent ` ##` No we did n ##' ##t ' ##' Ohio State front man Andy G ##ei ##ger is ` ##` retiring ' ##' after 11 years at the helm .
[unused1] [unused2] All ##egation ##s have come to light that several OS ##U players received illegal benefits including cash , access to cars , etc ##. .
[unused1] [unused2] It should n ##' ##t surprise Buck ##eye fans either , since T ##ress ##el had similar problems at Young ##stown State , and left a wake of controversy behind himself there as well , including - ##LR ##B ##- surprise - ##R ##RB ##- illegal benefits including cash , cars , grade fixing , etc ##. .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course , it was discovered that his men ' ##s basketball coach had directly given six grand to a Yugoslavia ##n recruit , but that was just his s ##tip ##end for travel and coach Jim O ##' ##B ##rien was just having a problem with the currency exchange rates ... right Andy ?
[unused1] [unused2] The first thing that needs to happen is that Bet ##tman and Good ##eno ##w - ##LR ##B ##- the players ' association re ##p - ##R ##RB ##- need to be fired , deported , fl ##ogged , ta ##rred and feather ##ed and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program , four dogs , four beers , and two co ##kes and parking to a game at an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go th ##ru to see a hockey game .
[unused1] [unused2] That means no team would own any player , and the owners would be free to sign whom ##ever they ' ##d like using the ` ##` fiscal restraint ' ##' they all drone ##d on and on about all year .
[unused1] [unused2] S ##hare ##s of Martha Stewart Living O ##m ##ni ##media , a company whose name is so breath ##taking ##ly self ##- ##p ##rom ##oting it makes me long for the days when every single entity involve in real estate or casino ##s was called Trump , continues to so ##ar ; it rose $ 1 ##. ##7 ##8 , or 7 ##. ##29 % , on news that the company ' ##s namesake will star in a new TV show once she , er ... gets out of prison .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , I know there have been su ##cc ##es ##ful companies that dealt with c ##rook ##s - ##LR ##B ##- Warner Communications , which started as a merger between business in the three most mob ##- ##in ##f ##lue ##nce ##d industries around , comes to mind - ##R ##RB ##- , but it ' ##s a g ##amble and not a business strategy .
[unused1] [unused2] The company ' ##s performance was n ##' ##t all that hot even before the CEO went to prison , and until very recently the stock price reflected that .
[unused1] [unused2] And she ' ##s been con ##vin ##cted of o ##bs ##truction of justice .
[unused1] [unused2] This run ##up is based on the in ##ex ##p ##lica ##ble hope that now that the head of the firm and the em ##bo ##di ##ment of a much ##- ##res ##ented brand is no longer doing time for lying to the Federal government , they ' ##ll be able to really coin some money .
[unused1] [unused2] Take 10 contestants , and give them a situation : You have company coming over for dinner ; You ' ##re hosting an open house ; or , You ' ##re hosting a wedding reception .
[unused1] [unused2] That business is O ##- ##V ##- ##E ##- ##R - ##- Between pay ##- ##per ##- ##view , video ##- ##on ##- ##de ##mand , pirate ##d movies , high ##- ##band ##wi ##dt ##h Internet broadcasts , and the increasing availability of other media , it takes some faith to see any future for movie rental ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course , there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea , but P ##su ##ed ##o ##. ##com failed without producing a single show , and Broadcast ##. ##com was swallowed for $ 6 billion by Yahoo ##! , to Yahoo ##!
[unused1] [unused2] The recent rumors about W ##al ##M ##art ' ##s plans to buy out a shipping company have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route .
[unused1] [unused2] So Oracle and Peoples ##oft , who spent the last 18 months insulting one another in every im ##agi ##na ##ble way , are finally tying the knot ?
[unused1] [unused2] How much of Peoples ##oft ' ##s most valuable - ##- human - ##- resources will walk out the door the day their options vest ? - ##R ##RB ##-
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##ll have to stick with con ##de ##m ##ning the merger as a totally un ##work ##able deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other .
[unused1] [unused2] And I w ##o n ##' ##t dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out of Oracle , starting his own company , and forcing Ellison to spend $ 10 ##. ##3 billion to get his company - ##- but not him - ##- back - ##LR ##B ##- though it does rather delight ##fully remind me of Coca ##- ##C ##ola basically giving away the b ##ott ##ling franchise and then spending billion ##s to buy it back - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] Ellison is brilliant enough to make this merger work , but he ' ##s crazy enough to wreck even the sound ##est of deals .
[unused1] [unused2] Need ##less to say , W ##ynn sold when everyone else bought , and he made it through the can ##ni ##bal ##izing near ##- ##co ##lla ##pse those casino ##s faced in the early 90 ' ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificial ##ly low price for Yu ##kos assets - ##LR ##B ##- hence that firm ' ##s bankruptcy filing a few days ago - ##- you know it ' ##s bad when you have to use US courts to protect your own assets from app ##ropriation by your home country - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] Au ##ction ##eers reported a $ 9 ##. ##3 billion winning bid for Yu ##gan ##sk ##ne ##ft ##ga ##z - ##- the company ' ##s main asset , worth two to three times that amount - ##- by an anonymous company located in T ##ver .
[unused1] [unused2] It turns out the anonymous company , Bai ##kal ##F ##ina ##ns ##G ##roup , shares an address with O ##O ##O T ##vern ##ef ##tem ##ash , which was recently bought by Z ##A ##O G ##az ##p ##rom ##ge ##oc ##oms ##er ##vice , not to ever be confused by the similarly ##- ##named G ##az ##p ##rom - ##LR ##B ##- which by the way has a similar logo - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] G ##az ##p ##rom may have arranged some last ##- ##min ##ute debt financing , or might have an outside partner , but I seriously doubt they were n ##' ##t in some way involved with the company that won the auction .
[unused1] [unused2] Watching a stock drop after hours , open lower , and close even lower than that makes me wonder just who ' ##s selling : a run ##up usually builds on a gradual c ##res ##cend ##o of greater ##- ##fo ##ol theory - ##- everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumb ##er - ##- and ends when the greatest fool yet gets sick of the whole thing and bail ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Anyway , I still think the V ##io ##x ##x risk is over ##est ##imated - ##- if the tobacco industry can sell something with no health benefits for years , get sued , and 1 - ##R ##RB ##- Keep the product on the shelves , 2 - ##R ##RB ##- Re ##ma ##in in business , and 3 - ##R ##RB ##- do 2 - ##R ##RB ##- to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits , we Me ##rc ##kers might be safe .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s a dying organization , and this will be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of so ##m ##nam ##bula ##nt s ##tag ##gering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient companies .
[unused1] [unused2] The Capital S ##pectator reports on the latest : Not only China , but India ' ##s state oil company has decided to get into the Yu ##kos ##- ##dis ##me ##mber ##ment trade .
[unused1] [unused2] Fr ##ene ##tic merger and acquisition activity does n ##' ##t mean much in the early days of a business - ##- it ' ##s just as likely that ridiculous ##ly over ##fu ##nded start ##ups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerate ##s as it is that forward ##- ##thin ##king vision ##aries are cutting off their competitors early .
[unused1] [unused2] But when an outsider buys into the business once it ' ##s established itself as important , but before it ' ##s really gotten profitable , it ' ##s big news .
[unused1] [unused2] For now , it ' ##s just a rumor that Ask Je ##eves is buying B ##log ##lines .
[unused1] [unused2] Apparently Yu ##gan ##sk ##ne ##ft ##eg ##az , which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state - ##LR ##B ##- yes , the same state that 1 - ##R ##RB ##- forced Yu ##kos to do the auction , and 2 - ##R ##RB ##- ran the auction , not that 3 - ##R ##RB ##- this is suspicious or anything - ##R ##RB ##- , and which was then being bought with foreign assistance , is not being bought with foreign assistance .
[unused1] [unused2] Anyway , it looks like they ' ##re denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny - ##- you ' ##d think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out .
[unused1] [unused2] Today , Ask Je ##eves made their official announcement about acquiring B ##log ##lines .
[unused1] [unused2] And this is , as far as I know , the first time since the Allegheny deal that there ' ##s been a hostile takeover using debt .
[unused1] [unused2] And then MC ##I just sort of accepted a V ##eri ##zon deal without really bothering anybody .
[unused1] [unused2] And now , they ' ##re swallowed by Just Another Mon ##oli ##th .
[unused1] [unused2] Will we have that at the Fed , when Greens ##pan leaves
[unused1] [unused2] North ##shore Management , the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds , is now facing actual SEC action .
[unused1] [unused2] Though , of course , there ' ##s always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shorts ##ight ##ed , not actually criminal ; apparently , the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled - ##- so they ' ##re guilty of front ##- ##run ##ning , at the least .
[unused1] [unused2] These inside ##r sales were certainly stupid , and probably criminal - ##LR ##B ##- though the legal proof may be hard to come by - ##R ##RB ##- but the solution is easy enough : They need to buy stock from the company itself , at some premium to the prices at which they sold - ##- they ' ##ll have the same stake as before , the shareholders would have gotten their money back - ##LR ##B ##- since the premium goes to the company , which is owned by the shareholders - ##R ##RB ##- , and there ' ##s no need to disrupt their business by taking the matter to court .
[unused1] [unused2] What ' ##s notable in this debate , however , is that according to MS ##N Money ##cent ##ral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that ` ##` While North Carolina ' ##s ex ##cise tax is only 5 cents , the total taxes given to North Carolina by smoke ##rs adds up to more than 61 cents per pack . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Okay , okay - ##- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states , that ' ##s technically accurate .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##d love to call it a classic raid - ##- he ' ##s making an offer for the company , no ##mina ##ting his own board , claiming management can accept one or the other or both , and hint ##ing that if they paid him enough , he ' ##d probably go away .
[unused1] [unused2] In this case , the most interesting twist is that he ' ##s short ##ing shares of My ##lan ' ##s acquisition target , King Ph ##arma ##ce ##utical ##s ; he ' ##s basically doubling down on the bet that they w ##o n ##' ##t acquire .
[unused1] [unused2] Not only that , but if My ##lan bought him out , they ' ##d have less money to fund a purchase of King Ph ##arma ##ce ##utical ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurs ##hip for a conference at Harvard Business School .
[unused1] [unused2] The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Re ##sponsible Business .
[unused1] [unused2] In 2004 , I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas M ##c ##C ##omb ##s Business School .
[unused1] [unused2] Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference .
[unused1] [unused2] I met student after student intent on harness ##ing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world .
[unused1] [unused2] But on the subject of succession , those two look like role models compared with insurance giant American International Group Inc ##. - ##LR ##B ##- AI ##G - ##R ##RB ##- , whose aging CEO has no plans to retire .
[unused1] [unused2] Maurice R ##. ` ##` Hank ' ##' Greenberg , who turns 80 in May , groom ##ed two sons to be successors , but both have since left AI ##G ##. ##G ##reen ##berg Sr ##. then created an office of the chairman in 2002 , which includes co ##- ##CO ##Os Martin J ##. Sullivan and Donald P ##. Ka ##na ##k .
[unused1] [unused2] Both are considered possible successors , but the board w ##o n ##' ##t know Greenberg ' ##s preference until his departure , when it opens a sealed letter .
[unused1] [unused2] Is there high turnover among senior managers ?
[unused1] [unused2] If the CEO is new , I also look at the performance of the CEO ' ##s previous company .
[unused1] [unused2] I am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took a sudden turn for the worse after the CEO left .
[unused1] [unused2] Yesterday ' ##s bad day for Kris ##py K ##rem ##e included some speculation that the new securities lawsuit filed against the company would be granted class action status .
[unused1] [unused2] If you are interested in getting information about securities class actions for a company , you should check out the Stanford Law School ' ##s Securities Class Action Clear ##ing ##house .
[unused1] [unused2] Researchers affiliated with the clearing ##house just released an interesting report about securities class action trends during 2004 .
[unused1] [unused2] The results highlight trends in types of filing ##s - ##LR ##B ##- increase in product market related filing ##s - ##R ##RB ##- , affected sectors - ##LR ##B ##- big increase in energy & technology sector - ##R ##RB ##- , and overall number of filing ##s - ##LR ##B ##- fairly steady - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] It can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice new job .
[unused1] [unused2] You might also want to be wary if the CEO or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced .
[unused1] [unused2] Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28 % since January of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely .
[unused1] [unused2] So I will thankful ##ly accept the low fare ##s , be ##mo ##an the loss of food on flights , and watch these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy .
[unused1] [unused2] Both companies have been pen ##ali ##zed for these actions and have continued to rest ##ru ##cture operations , sell assets , and lay ##off employees .
[unused1] [unused2] Interest ##ing aside : Star ##bu ##cks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Kris ##py K ##rem ##e .
[unused1] [unused2] President Bush today renewed his call for a $ 250 ##, ##00 ##0 cap on pain and suffering damages from the victims of medical ma ##l ##pra ##ctic ##e .
[unused1] [unused2] Here to debate medical ma ##l ##pra ##ctic ##e reform are consumer advocate Ralph Na ##der and Dr ##. Donald Palm ##isan ##o , the president ##- ##ele ##ct of the American Medical Association .
[unused1] [unused2] Over 80 ##, ##00 ##0 Americans , 220 every day die from medical ne ##gli ##gence , hundred of thousands are injured .
[unused1] [unused2] That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they ca n ##' ##t afford it .
[unused1] [unused2] Can you say that the lawyers , the trial lawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into Democratic co ##ffer ##s in order to keep this , do you believe that this is healthy ...
[unused1] [unused2] Well , as much as they ' ##ve poured into those co ##ffer ##s , it ' ##s much less than what the doctors , the ma ##l ##pra ##ctic ##e ins ##urers , the hospital chains and the HM ##Os and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress ' co ##ffer ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that ' ##s the wrong lung or a double mast ##ec ##tom ##y that was n ##' ##t indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the Midwest , or that organ transplant that was in ##com ##pa ##tible on that 17 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old teenager in North Carolina .
[unused1] [unused2] Are we going to say to these and so many others , you ca n ##' ##t have your full day in court ?
[unused1] [unused2] There was a hear on Capitol Hill today .
[unused1] [unused2] He ' ##s the father of a little girl , 13 ##- ##mont ##h ##- ##old girl , who he said today died because of medical ma ##l ##pra ##ctic ##e .
[unused1] [unused2] She died awaiting surgery .
[unused1] [unused2] Does that look like a Lot ##tery winner to you , holding a picture of his dead baby ?
[unused1] [unused2] That ' ##s why we founded the National Pat ##ient Safety Foundation .
[unused1] [unused2] And what we ' ##re finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing , trauma centers are closing , pregnant women ca n ##' ##t find a doctor to deliver the baby , a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state .
[unused1] [unused2] The patient had to be air ##ava ##cked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage .
[unused1] [unused2] Who are you , who ' ##s our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $ 250 ##, ##00 ##0 for the loss of a child ?
[unused1] [unused2] It brought stability to California and o ##bs ##te ##tric ##ians in California will pay 55 , 57 , $ 60 ##, ##00 ##0 in Los Angeles and in South Florida in Miami , they ' ##ll pay $ 210 ##, ##00 ##0 ... - ##LR ##B ##- CR ##OS ##ST ##AL ##K - ##R ##RB ##-
[unused1] [unused2] And in some states , for example , there are doctors that are - ##- you know , there are 45 pay ##outs in ten years and they ' ##re not discipline ##d by the state medical board .
[unused1] [unused2] I mean , you ' ##ve got 5 percent of the doctors accounting for over 55 percent of the pay ##offs , Paul .
[unused1] [unused2] It lists multiple claims against one physician when actually it ' ##s really one claim , different ins ##urers pay on the same physician and it ' ##s counted as one claim .
[unused1] [unused2] Right now in South Florida , in South Florida , the latest poll shows that every ne ##uro ##su ##rge ##on has been sued .

[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m in charge of getting everyone excited about contact ##ing organizations so Marcel ##la can meet with them .
[unused1] [unused2] Remember to stress that Marcel ##la can either meet with the ex ##ec ##s or the whole group - ##LR ##B ##- whatever works best - ##R ##RB ##- , that she will be talking briefly , and that she will be there because she wants to learn about that group ' ##s concerns and issues at A ##& ##M .
[unused1] [unused2] If they are interested in setting up a meeting then have them contact me at 97 ##9 ##- ##7 ##7 ##7 ##- ##64 ##45 or at la ##urous ##e ##. ##. ##. ##@ ##yah ##oo ##. ##com and I will send the info to Tori , or have them contact Tori Foster to set up a time .
[unused1] [unused2] Also , let me know who you have already contacted and set up a meeting with so that I can make sure we do n ##' ##t call them twice .
[unused1] [unused2] Ok guys , sorry for the long e ##- ##mail and the ram ##bling , but I want to make sure that I have everything covered .
[unused1] [unused2] An old friend , Joseph B ##rit ##t of Ken ##nes ##aw , GA , recently email ##ed to ask about anti ##- ##im ##mi ##gration as an issue for Virginia Democrats .
[unused1] [unused2] He gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of dollars while getting yanked around by the Immigration Service ... not to mention , he ' ##s paying the government thousands in taxes .
[unused1] [unused2] They are n ##' ##t paying lawyers , and they pay nothing into the system .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course , the Americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to pay in cash because it means cheaper labor for them .
[unused1] [unused2] The employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native ##- ##born Americans and legal immigrants .
[unused1] [unused2] And families who hire cheap domestic labor , whether to clean the house , wash the laundry or maintain the lawn .
[unused1] [unused2] Poor , native ##- ##born Americans who otherwise would be paid higher wages for their manual labor .
[unused1] [unused2] And the rest of us who w ##o n ##' ##t hire anyone to work for us unless they ' ##re paying their taxes , even if it means we pay more .
[unused1] [unused2] we ' ##ve seen in the past in b ##os ##nia for example , you held elections and all of the old ethnic th ##ugs get into power because they have organization and they have money and they stop the process of genuine building of democracy .
[unused1] [unused2] a key faction bidding for control announced it will protest the presence of a prominent i ##ra ##qi exile leader .
[unused1] [unused2] the head of the i ##ra ##qi democratic movement says his group will hold a demonstration in na ##sir ##iya ##h to den ##ou ##nce the presence of ah ##mad ch ##ala ##bi .
[unused1] [unused2] he was escorted into i ##ra ##q t ##ues ##day by u ##. ##s ##. marine ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] ch ##ala ##bi staged his own rally yesterday to support his bid to become the next leader of i ##ra ##q .
[unused1] [unused2] Some 2 ##, ##500 mainly university students formed a human chain in Japanese characters spelling out ` ##` No War ' ##' in Osaka on Sunday to protest against the ongoing US ##- ##led military campaign in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We can not forgive this war , ' ##' Mi ##ya ##ko Fuji , 20 , one of the rally ' ##s organise ##rs told Ji ##ji news agency .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` I want to join together the feelings of each of us as individuals who oppose the war . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] The protest follows a string of others involving tens of thousands of peace activists across Japan since January .
[unused1] [unused2] According to a poll by K ##yo ##do news agency released Saturday , 78 of 100 people surveyed opposed the military action in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] A separate poll of 1 ##, ##8 ##46 adults by the leading Yo ##mi ##uri newspaper published Tuesday showed 64 percent felt Japan had ` ##` no choice ' ##' but to back the United States , with only 12 percent saying Japan had ` ##` every reason ' ##' to back the war .
[unused1] [unused2] Some 70 people were arrested Saturday as demons ##tra ##tors clashed with police at the end of a major peace rally here , as at least 200 ##, ##00 ##0 anti ##- ##war protesters took to the streets across the United States and Canada .
[unused1] [unused2] For the most part the march ##es went off peacefully , but in New York a small group of protesters were arrested after they refused to go home at the end of their rally , police sources said .
[unused1] [unused2] Several police officers were treated for the effects of gas after the ensuing clashes - ##- a result , police said , of the demons ##tra ##tors using self ##- ##de ##fen ##ce devices .
[unused1] [unused2] Organ ##isers claimed that some 250 ##, ##00 ##0 people attended the rally , creating a human column some three kilometres - ##LR ##B ##- 1 ##. ##8 miles - ##R ##RB ##- long .
[unused1] [unused2] The city assigned 2 ##, ##00 ##0 police officers to the rally , including undercover officers who carried bee ##per ##- ##si ##zed radiation detector ##s and other counter ##- ##ter ##ro ##rism equipment .
[unused1] [unused2] Though opinion polls have shown public support for the war rising in the United States , opposition to military intervention in Iraq has given rise to an imp ##ass ##ioned campaign .

[unused1] [unused2] Lia ##na Owen drove 10 hours from Pennsylvania to attend the rally in Manhattan with her parents .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` It ' ##s important that people all over the world know that we do n ##' ##t believe in the war , ' ##' she said .
[unused1] [unused2] Several thousand demons ##tra ##tors also gathered outside the White House in Washington , accompanied by a major security presence .
[unused1] [unused2] Some of the slogan ##s sought to re ##but war supporters ' arguments that the protests are un ##pa ##tri ##otic .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We support our troops - ##- bring them home ! ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] One group , Les ##bian ##s Against Boys In ##va ##ding Anything , carried signs saying ` ##` Pre ##- ##em ##pt ##ive war is terrorism , ' ##' ` ##` This is n ##' ##t the USA I love , ' ##' and ` ##` Where Will the Bomb ##s Fall Next ? ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Up to 20 ##, ##00 ##0 protesters th ##rong ##ed the plaza ##s and streets of San Francisco , where more than 1 ##, ##60 ##0 people were arrested in the past two days in a civil di ##so ##bedience campaign .
[unused1] [unused2] Between 2 ##, ##500 and 3 ##, ##00 ##0 people pick ##eted the CNN studios in Los Angeles while others at the Atlanta headquarters protested the cable network ' ##s coverage of the war for being bias ##ed toward the United States .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` They make this look like a John Wayne movie , ' ##' said protest ##er Elvis Woods .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` You watch CNN and all you get are explosions and video of tanks and guns .
[unused1] [unused2] Nobody questions whether this is right or not . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Counter ##- ##de ##mons ##tration ##s in support of the US ##- ##led invasion of Iraq took place in some cities , with some 2 ##, ##500 people turning out in Chicago .
[unused1] [unused2] Flying the US flag and re ##citing the pledge of allegiance , they outnumbered their anti ##- ##war counterparts by three to one .
[unused1] [unused2] Carr ##ying signs that said , ` ##` It ' ##s the oil , stupid , ' ##' and ` ##` Real men do n ##' ##t bomb children , ' ##' the anti ##- ##war protesters waved blue Earth flags .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` It ' ##s crazy that we ' ##re bombing Iraq .

[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` I ' ##m here to support him and others who are fighting for their country .
[unused1] [unused2] They would n ##' ##t be here if it were n ##' ##t for the freedom ##s that others fought for , ' ##' she said .
[unused1] [unused2] Anti ##- ##war protests took place around the world Saturday after the start of the bombing of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Hundreds of thousands of demons ##tra ##tors took to the streets in Britain , Spain and Italy , whose governments approved of the war .
[unused1] [unused2] In Montreal , ` ##` Stop the War , ' ##' a coalition of more than 190 groups , said as many as 200 ##, ##00 ##0 people turned out , though police refused to give a figure .
[unused1] [unused2] Pro ##test ##ers also gathered in their thousands in Halifax , Calgary , Edmonton and Vancouver .
