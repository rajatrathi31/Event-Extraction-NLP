[unused1] [unused2] Orders went out today to deploy 17 ##, ##00 ##0 U ##. ##S ##. Army soldiers in the Persian Gulf region .
[unused1] [unused2] We ' ##re talking about possibilities of full scale war with former Congressman Tom Andrews , Democrat of Maine .
[unused1] [unused2] He ' ##s now national director of Win Without War , and former Congressman Bob Do ##rna ##n , Republican of California .
[unused1] [unused2] Bob , one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world do n ##' ##t want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration .
[unused1] [unused2] Our president has repeatedly , for example , relied on a man whom you ' ##re aware , Hussein Ka ##mel , Saddam Hussein ' ##s son ##- ##in ##- ##law , leader of the Iraq arms program who defect ##ed for a time .
[unused1] [unused2] And gave us a whole lot of information and then went home and his father ##- ##in ##- ##law killed him .
[unused1] [unused2] The fact that this guy was such an idiot to go back and let his father ##- ##in ##- ##law kill him shows he was n ##' ##t the most stable of people .
[unused1] [unused2] Paul , look , the problem is I would s ##tip ##ulate all four of us hates war .
[unused1] [unused2] Any rational person hates war .
[unused1] [unused2] Clinton suffered greatly over the 19 Rangers that died , 18 on the 3rd of October and Matt Re ##erse ##n - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- three days later .
[unused1] [unused2] I visited all their families .
[unused1] [unused2] Let me tell you , what trips to Walter Reed taught me was , that whoever thought up the term , the law of un ##int ##ended consequences it per ##tains to war .
[unused1] [unused2] He will blow a city off the earth in a minute if he can get the hold of the means to do it .
[unused1] [unused2] Tom Andrews , I think we all realize that a government does n ##' ##t go to war a nation goes to war .
[unused1] [unused2] And so I would like you to take a look at the CNN / ` ##` USA TO ##DA ##Y ' ##' / G ##all ##up poll , taken last week , should U ##. ##S ##. troops to go to Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power .
[unused1] [unused2] F ##av ##or 59 % , opposed 37 % , that ' ##s a vast ##ly larger support than President Bush Senior had in getting the U ##. ##S ##. troops out of Kuwait before that war started .
[unused1] [unused2] Ask them about going and not just a war , Bob , but an invasion and occupying for up to 10 years a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the most di ##stable and volatile regions in the world .
[unused1] [unused2] They ' ##re not coming forward and telling us what the risks are , what the costs are , how many years we might be in , the possibility of us getting b ##ogged down , because what Americans know that , they ' ##re opposed to this war .
[unused1] [unused2] The more they learn about this invasion , the more they learn about this occupation , the less they support it .
[unused1] [unused2] That ' ##s going to have to be last war , unfair and unfortunate as that is , I am sorry , they ' ##re telling us we ' ##re out of time .
[unused1] [unused2] As they get ready to head over hostile territory , 10 men aboard this Air Force HC ##- ##13 ##0 search and rescue and re ##fueling plane start to feel their adrenaline rushing .
[unused1] [unused2] - ##LR ##B ##- on camera - ##R ##RB ##- : What stops though - we know the Iraqi ##s have fired sand missiles and fired AAA at aircraft all throughout this war .
[unused1] [unused2] They have n ##' ##t hit anybody , but is n ##' ##t it risky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you .
[unused1] [unused2] We know where they ' ##re at so we simply avoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do see us , we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their ammunition .
[unused1] [unused2] The plane arrived back to base safely .
[unused1] [unused2] Eight hundred of those sort ##ies will be strike sort ##ies using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in the amount of air power being used over Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] This programming note , tomorrow at noon Eastern I ' ##ll have a special interview with the nation ' ##s top military officer , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , as coalition forces push north , they are encounter ##ing a unique problem of combat , getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy .
[unused1] [unused2] See ##ming ##ly deserted , these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] The tough ##est fight , though , may lie ahead in the heart of the Iraqi capital .
[unused1] [unused2] Pentagon sources say the first phase of the final push into Baghdad is now under way .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. ##- ##led forces were able to press farther north after defeating Iraqi Republican Guard units at Ka ##rb ##ala and Ku ##t - ##LR ##B ##- p ##h - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] Our embedded reporters say the two ##- ##p ##rong ##ed advance appears to be moving faster than commanders expected .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi ##s who initially were cautious when U ##. ##S ##. forces arrived in Na ##ja ##f ended cheer ##ing them on , shaking their hands and pat ##ting their backs .
[unused1] [unused2] U ##. ##S ##. Army ' ##s 7th Cavalry is in the forefront of U ##. ##S ##. troops since they first left Kuwait and crossed directly into the Iraqi desert .
[unused1] [unused2] Our Walter Rodgers is embedded with the unit ' ##s 3rd Squadron , which is leading the 3rd Infantry Division ' ##s march toward the Iraqi capital .
[unused1] [unused2] Throughout the day , as the U ##. ##S ##. Army 7th Cavalry punched northward in the general direction of Baghdad , we have seen huge convoys of supply troops moving ever northward .
[unused1] [unused2] Earlier in the day , the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took Ka ##rb ##ala with a minimum of fight .
[unused1] [unused2] Additionally , the 7th Cavalry has pushed onward in the general direction of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Throughout the day , we have watched the 3rd Infantry Division bring in prisoners of war .
[unused1] [unused2] Iraqi soldiers glad the war is over for them , perhaps 100 at a time .
[unused1] [unused2] There were times when the 7th Cavalry itself got into some ski ##rm ##ishes as it pushed forward , again in the direction of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] There was a bit of a fire ##fight when the 7th Cavalry came upon three Soviet vintage 20 - mill ##imeter anti ##- ##air ##craft guns , a ##ck ##- ##ack guns .
[unused1] [unused2] The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortar ##s in the direction of the 7th Cavalry .
[unused1] [unused2] The Apache troop opened its tank guns , opened its own mortar ##s , de ##ci ##mated that unit , put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqi ##s in the process .
[unused1] [unused2] This as it continues to push ever closer towards the southern suburbs of Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] The speed as they push to Baghdad seems to have gathered pace overnight and in the course of this morning .
[unused1] [unused2] The intensity it ' ##s very quick moving , very fluid battle .
[unused1] [unused2] Over ##night and early this morning , the tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles of the 3rd Infantry Division backed by the Apache attack helicopters of the 11th Aviation Regiment punched through the Republican Guard defenses in and around Ka ##rb ##ala .
[unused1] [unused2] They were then able to advance far north of that city and , as we speak , U ##. ##S ##. commanders tell me that elements of the 3rd Infantry Division are now literally just a few miles from Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] Eight ##- ##fi ##ft ##een a ##. ##m ##. Iraq ' ##s information minister reads a message he says is from Saddam Hussein urging Iraqi ##s to step up attacks against coalition forces .
[unused1] [unused2] Eight ##- ##thi ##rt ##y ##- ##si ##x a ##. ##m ##. Walter Rodgers reports according to Army sources , Iraqi officials are fleeing Baghdad in drove ##s , using civilian convoys top avoid being targeted by coalition air strikes .
[unused1] [unused2] Eight ##- ##fort ##y ##- ##th ##ree a ##. ##m ##. CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr reports coalition troops entering Baghdad were met with fierce fighting , and there were casualties on both sides .
[unused1] [unused2] Nine ##- ##oh ##- ##si ##x a ##. ##m ##. CNN ' ##s Martin Sa ##vid ##ge , embedded with the 1st Battalion , 7th Marines , reports the unit has reached the extreme southeast suburbs of Baghdad , adding to forces the U ##. ##S ##. says now en ##ci ##rcle the city .
[unused1] [unused2] The coalition air force will begin providing urban combat air support over the city .
[unused1] [unused2] Twelve ##- ##t ##wen ##ty ##- ##one p ##. ##m ##. CNN ' ##s Wolf B ##litz ##er reports according to an eye ##wi ##t ##ness , a bomb has hit central Baghdad only a few hundred meters from the Palestine Hotel .
[unused1] [unused2] Behind the scenes privately here you get a p ##al ##pable sense of v ##ind ##ica ##tion , although publicly caution is the watch ##word here , administration officials from the vice president on down saying the war is not over yet .
[unused1] [unused2] Some of the tough ##est fighting could still be ahead .
[unused1] [unused2] But they do believe the pictures out of Baghdad today , on the one hand , send as powerful a message as you can send to the people in the Arab world who have criticized this war .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course , at the same time , though , the White House worries that the American people might see these pictures and think the war is over .
[unused1] [unused2] Defense Secretary R ##ums ##feld and Vice President Cheney among those saying the tough ##est fighting might still lie ahead , still un ##ans ##wer ##ed questions about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein and other key members of the Iraqi leadership .
[unused1] [unused2] Bottom line , with less than half of the ground forces and two ##- ##thi ##rds of the air assets used 12 years ago in Desert Storm , Secretary R ##ums ##feld and General Franks have achieved a far more difficult objective .
[unused1] [unused2] Yet until this war is fully won , we can not be over ##con ##fi ##dent in our position .
[unused1] [unused2] So , again , behind the scenes , a sense of v ##ind ##ica ##tion , but also a cautious attitude because of the fighting still to come .
[unused1] [unused2] I have to tell you , though , Judy , the CIA Director George Ten ##et walked out of the White House a short time ago with a giant smile on his face .
[unused1] [unused2] Well , John , given all that you ' ##ve said , we know that there ' ##s an American retired general waiting in Kuwait .
[unused1] [unused2] Jay Garner the retired general will go into Iraq soon with his troops soon .
[unused1] [unused2] And beginning as early as next week , there will be a series of town meetings , if you will .
[unused1] [unused2] Now , we know , one person who will be invited is planning process , those planning meetings , is Ahmed Cha ##la ##bi .
[unused1] [unused2] He will be involved in the planning and in those meetings .
[unused1] [unused2] But I also should report that there is a sense of annoyance here at the White House , even among some of Mr ##. Cha ##la ##bi ' ##s top supporters , that , since returning to Iraq in recent days , he has complained frequently , including on our air earlier today , that the United States is moving too slowly to get in the reconstruction efforts , to restore electricity and restore water .
[unused1] [unused2] And Mr ##. R ##ums ##feld went on to say , Secretary R ##ums ##feld went on to say , there is still a war going on , still quite a dangerous situation - ##- Judy .
[unused1] [unused2] Still to come : warfare amid the celebrations in Baghdad .
[unused1] [unused2] As Iraqi ##s poured into the streets to mark their apparent new freedom , American troops come under fire from a different area .
[unused1] [unused2] We are going to be having a so ##ck painting party at my house instead of the normal meeting at St ##. Mary ' ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] - Start on Texas Ave ##. and head away from Bryan - Go down Texas Ave ##. until you come to South West Parkway - Take right on S ##W Parkway - Go down S ##W Parkway until you come to Welsh - ##LR ##B ##- stop ##light - ##R ##RB ##- - Take right on Welsh - The apartment complex is called Renaissance Park and is on the immediate left - Go into second entrance of the complex on left - ##LR ##B ##- mail ##box should be on right side - ##R ##RB ##- - Park anywhere - I am in building 24 apartment # 241 - We will possibly be out back around pool if no one answers door
[unused1] [unused2] Everyone has heard the story : Beat ##riz Marine ##llo was elected USC ##F President on August 11 , 2003 in Los Angeles .
[unused1] [unused2] Immediately after she took office , she found out that the USC ##F had no money in the bank , zero .
[unused1] [unused2] Therefore , on August 20 , 2003 , brave ##ly Beat ##riz walked into the USC ##F Office ##s in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members .
[unused1] [unused2] John M ##c ##C ##rary resigned from the board as a result .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course , it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beat ##riz fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that she worked for the USC ##F in 1999 ##- ##20 ##00 .
[unused1] [unused2] It took six weeks before the USC ##F paid the guaranteed prizes the prize winners had won at the US Open .
[unused1] [unused2] At s ##cho ##lastic tournaments , no cash prizes are paid .
[unused1] [unused2] However , in adult tournaments , the players expect to receive their prizes , and to receive them immediately .
[unused1] [unused2] For this act of stupid ##ity which had caused a grave crisis in the USC ##F , the accountant was immediately fired .
[unused1] [unused2] Had the existence of this $ 85 ##, ##00 ##0 in a secret bank account been known , it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away .
[unused1] [unused2] Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them , but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly , in the same day .
[unused1] [unused2] He was asked to wait until after the LA meeting was over before resign ##ing .
[unused1] [unused2] We also had a buyer for the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a commitment for 4 % bank financing in Cross ##ville .
[unused1] [unused2] Staff reduction ##s were clearly in the works pending system changes that would be facilitated by any move , Miami , P ##B ##G , Cross ##ville or elsewhere .
[unused1] [unused2] To make the staff cuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for M ##c ##C ##rary & Cam ##ara ##tta ' ##s departure ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] When I offered to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain and c ##lar ##ify all this , I was told I was not welcome .
[unused1] [unused2] It is no coincidence that the employees let go included substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Cross ##ville , including - ##LR ##B ##- remarkably - ##R ##RB ##- the employee of the year !
[unused1] [unused2] It has been suggested that there is , or was at one time , some sort of delegates ' motion which established a minimum period between the time someone could leave the E ##B and the time someone could be hired by the USC ##F .
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s irrelevant because the R ##EA ##L question is whether an active board member can , while on the board , arrange to be given money by the USC ##F .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course it ' ##s in the by ##laws that an active board member can not be given money by the USC ##F while on the board .
[unused1] [unused2] It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board .
[unused1] [unused2] Su ##pp ##ose , for example , there were to be a proposal to the effect that each E ##B member would be given $ 10 ##, ##00 ##0 upon the ex ##piration of his ##/ ##her term .
[unused1] [unused2] If the board can not vote to give themselves present money , they can not vote to give themselves future money either .
[unused1] [unused2] Furthermore , it does n ##' ##t matter whether this arrangement is em ##bodied in an E ##B vote or not , or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a formal E ##B meeting or not .
[unused1] [unused2] A board member , while on the board , is supposed to be representing the interests of the USC ##F , not feather ##ing his ##/ ##her nest , in the present or in the future .
[unused1] [unused2] If a board member makes such arrangements , it is clearly an ethics violation , clearly a violation of the by ##laws , possibly end ##anger ##s our tax ##- ##ex ##em ##pt status , and is possibly a violation of law as well .
[unused1] [unused2] The purpose of having a ` ##` time limit ' ##' would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles ; that is , you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition ; it would give the voters time to elect a new E ##B that would consider the issues objective ##ly .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course , it is possible that someone could leave the board - without - ever having discussed being compensate ##d by the board in the future , and that then the remaining members could , for good reason , hire that person .
[unused1] [unused2] But this is neither here nor there , because the fact that Randy Bauer is already talking about Beat ##riz Marine ##llo as the USC ##F ' ##s new ` ##` move coordinator ' ##' , whatever that involves , and whether or not it means that she would be the de facto interim E ##D , means that at some level and in some form these discussions H ##AV ##E already taken place , while Marine ##llo is serving as President .
[unused1] [unused2] I mean , it ' ##s con ##ce ##ivable that the other six have all gotten together in Marine ##llo ' ##s absence and drafted her , but it also seems pretty clear that she has agreed to do it , and , if all the rumors are true and she steps down , it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities .
[unused1] [unused2] We pretty much know that Marine ##llo , while on the board , has arranged to get future money from the USC ##F .
[unused1] [unused2] - asking the Inter ##im E ##D to design ##ate someone from the New Windsor staff to act as move coordinator
[unused1] [unused2] - asking the Inter ##im E ##D to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job - ##LR ##B ##- there are such people - ##R ##RB ##-
[unused1] [unused2] One very bad argument that was made by Kevin Bach ##ler , which to be fair was surrounded by arguably better ones , was that since this board was elected , we should let them do as they please .
[unused1] [unused2] Which is to say that there might as well not be by ##laws , ethics standards , laws , etc ##. , since an elected board is not bound by any of them .
[unused1] [unused2] Another argument , which is better but still disturbing , is that , yes , this is an ethics violation , and maybe worse , but it would only hurt the USC ##F to talk about it , and that only trouble ##makers like Sam Sloan , Larry Pa ##rr , and , I suppose , me , would talk about it , since doing so will o ##bs ##truct the federation ' ##s plans , cause us to pay legal expenses , run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all , cause people not to loan us money , and so forth .
[unused1] [unused2] But if we are going to talk about realism , here is another realistic concern : I predict that , if , in fact , the rumors about the agenda for the Florida meeting prove true , and Marine ##llo resign ##s as President and is hired as move coordinator , the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan will file another lawsuit - ##LR ##B ##- or am ##end his current complaint - ##R ##RB ##- charging the USC ##F E ##B members with self ##- ##dea ##ling , violation of the USC ##F ' ##s own by ##laws , and every other thing , report us to the I ##RS , and demand that all USC ##F money ##s which might be used to paid Marine ##llo be frozen .
[unused1] [unused2] If he is willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non ##- ##p ##ro ##fit organization law , which might or might not be applicable to the USC ##F , why would n ##' ##t he file a lawsuit on the basis of the USC ##F ' ##s violation of its own by ##laws , which un ##quest ##ion ##ably AR ##E applicable to the USC ##F ?
[unused1] [unused2] It is i ##rri ##tating enough to get sued by Sam Sloan ; imagine how i ##rri ##tating it would be to get sued by Sam Sloan and B ##EA ##TE ##N by Sam Sloan because you have done something so e ##g ##re ##gio ##us that a court is forced to agree with him .
[unused1] [unused2] What is the recommended policy on com ##pen ##sat ##ing board members for attending meetings , when they have no vacation time left at work , and are attending the board meeting on their own time , without pay .
[unused1] [unused2] If your organization is a charity , it is generally considered to be inappropriate , and in some jurisdictions , it is illegal to compensate board members for their service .
[unused1] [unused2] It is reasonable , however , to re ##im ##bur ##se board members for legitimate and necessary expenses incurred in order to serve on the board .
[unused1] [unused2] I wonder if you could make a case for paying someone to replace the board member so the board member can attend meetings .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m not a lawyer , but it seems to me to be similar to re ##im ##bur ##sing a board member for a baby ##si ##tter , which no one questions .
[unused1] [unused2] Another possibility is to change the meeting times .
[unused1] [unused2] It is very difficult to find times for all of us to get together .
[unused1] [unused2] In I ##RS Public ##ation 55 ##7 , the sample draft articles of incorporation indicate that NO compensation may be paid to directors .
[unused1] [unused2] In fair ##ness , re ##im ##bur ##se ##ment of out ##- ##of ##- ##po ##cket expenses on behalf of the organization - ##- including travel and lo ##dging to attend board meetings - ##- are allowed .
[unused1] [unused2] However , Public ##ation 55 ##7 does not explicitly prohibit compensation to directors .
[unused1] [unused2] It is very legal , and an acceptable policy or practice in Canada to pay an honor ##arium or s ##tip ##ent for people on boards that are active .
[unused1] [unused2] Many do this , as they know it is an investment for the time and talents they need .
[unused1] [unused2] They also know , as do the recipients , the payment is but a percentage of the true worth of the time and effort , but does show respect for what they are re ##cie ##ving .
[unused1] [unused2] Being someone that works and lives in Canada , and in the non ##- ##p ##ro ##fit industry , it is done , and it is very legal .
[unused1] [unused2] Take a look at any of the large student unions , they all pay their elected board members an honor ##arium , as do many of the large foundations .
[unused1] [unused2] It is legal , and it is done .
[unused1] [unused2] The American rift with Syria deepened this week , with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the assassination of Lebanon ' ##s former prime minister in Beirut on Monday .
[unused1] [unused2] In the past two weeks , the officials said , France has re ##bu ##ffed appeals by Secretary of State Con ##do ##lee ##zza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister , Silva ##n S ##hal ##om , to list He ##z ##bol ##lah as a terrorist organization , which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups .
[unused1] [unused2] The United States has long called He ##z ##bol ##lah a terrorist organization , but the French , American and European officials said , have opposed doing so , and argue that making such a designation now would be un ##wise , given the new t ##ur ##bul ##ence in Lebanon .
[unused1] [unused2] Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president , Ma ##hm ##oud Abbas , has told them that he , too , regards He ##z ##bol ##lah as a destructive force in the Middle East , one determined to under ##mine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israeli ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] A European diplomat said the issue of calling He ##z ##bol ##lah a terrorist organization was discussed in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of the Clear ##ing House , a unit of the European Union that meets in confidential sessions to review terrorist activities in Europe .
[unused1] [unused2] They do n ##' ##t want to rock the boat now by attempting to star ##ve out the m ##ull ##ah ##s ' terror agent that conducts the pro ##xy attacks against Israel that Iran can not afford to do itself openly .
[unused1] [unused2] From Re ##uters : U ##. ##S ##. Marines rallied round a com ##rade under investigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive in Fall ##u ##ja , saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable , hair ##- ##tri ##gger circumstances .
[unused1] [unused2] Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they did n ##' ##t see the shooting as a scandal , rather the act of a com ##rade who faced intense pressure during the effort to que ##ll the ins ##urgency in the city .
[unused1] [unused2] He was probably running around being shot at for days on end in Fall ##u ##ja .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` I would have shot the ins ##urge ##nt too .
[unused1] [unused2] Of course the anti ##- ##A ##mer ##ica ##n world press is jumping all over this story , casually o ##mit ##ting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead ins ##urge ##nt that was b ##ooby ##- ##tra ##pped with explosives .
[unused1] [unused2] Ad ##d the tactic of b ##ooby ##- ##tra ##pping your own dead to the effective suicide bombings , and it ' ##s clear to say that the Geneva Convention is n ##' ##t on the minds of the insurgents .
[unused1] [unused2] For that I believe the Marines should handle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure their own safety and prevent a possible ambush .
[unused1] [unused2] I ' ##m no fan of this war either , but it i ##rks me to no end reading and listening to civilian opinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile war zones from their comfortable re ##cline ##rs .
[unused1] [unused2] To the world press and everyone else who des ##pis ##es the United States : You do n ##' ##t have to like our president or those operating this war , but get off the backs of the 18 , 19 and 20 year ##- ##old ##s thrown into a situation you will never see or have to encounter .
[unused1] [unused2] Chris Matthews , that idiot talking head over at MS ##NBC , said yesterday about the terrorists we fought in Fall ##u ##jah ` ##` a rival , I mean they ' ##re not bad guys especially , just people who just disagree with us ' ##' ... this just am ##az ##es me , the complete id ##io ##cy of this waste of human sperm .
[unused1] [unused2] These are the same terrorists blowing up families , ch ##opping off heads of civilians , and the complete di ##s ##regard for any human life and they just disagree with us ?
[unused1] [unused2] Tell that to the family of Margaret Hassan , the school teacher who was brutally tortured and then slaughtered by these same guys , they a ##i n ##' ##t so bad are they Chris Matthews ?
[unused1] [unused2] British officials say they believe Hassan was a blind ##fold ##ed woman seen being shot in the head by a hooded militant on a video obtained but not aired by the Arab television station Al ##- ##J ##az ##eera .
[unused1] [unused2] She would be the first foreign woman to die in the wave of kidnapping ##s in Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] On Sunday , Marines found the m ##uti ##lated body of what they believe was a Western woman on a street in Fall ##u ##jah during the U ##. ##S ##. assault on the ins ##urge ##nt stronghold .
[unused1] [unused2] These are the reasons that none of these mother ##ef ##fers should ever see the light of day ... they need to be all lined up and shot .
[unused1] [unused2] Tor ##tur ##ing this poor women for what ?
[unused1] [unused2] Mrs ##. Hassan speak s perfect Arabic and she has a heart of gold , she ' ##s been killed by - ##LR ##B ##- men in p ##aja ##mas - ##R ##RB ##- , turn Iraq upside down and find them .
[unused1] [unused2] The Marines will find them , and when they do they shall die .
[unused1] [unused2] It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro ##- ##uni ##ted nations that its almost sick ##ening to read .
[unused1] [unused2] Its U ##. ##N ##. reporter has been on the pay ##roll of the U ##. ##N ##. lobby .
[unused1] [unused2] Linda F ##as ##ulo , the U ##. ##N ##. correspondent for NBC News and MS ##NBC , has written a pro ##- ##U ##. ##N ##. book , An Inside ##r ' ##s Guide to the U ##. ##N ##. , which reads like the U ##. ##N ##. paid for it .
[unused1] [unused2] Actually , the pro ##- ##U ##. ##N ##. lobby paid for it .
[unused1] [unused2] In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter , F ##as ##ulo acknowledge ##s Ted Turner ' ##s U ##. ##N ##. Foundation and Better World Campaign for ` ##` their generous financial support ' ##' of her book project .
[unused1] [unused2] She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund ` ##` for helping to fund the project . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] Why would an NBC reporter - ##LR ##B ##- who also reports on the U ##. ##N ##. for National Public Radio - ##R ##RB ##- take money from the U ##. ##N ##. lobby ?
[unused1] [unused2] Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom B ##rok ##aw put his stamp of approval on the UN ##A ##- ##US ##A and BC ##UN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner .
[unused1] [unused2] She tries to blame the U ##. ##S ##. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it .
[unused1] [unused2] She admits , however , that , ` ##` The Rwanda massacre ##s occurred while Anna ##n was U ##. ##N ##.
[unused1] [unused2] The truth is that , as director of U ##. ##N ##. peace ##keeping , Anna ##n personally refused requests to author ##ize U ##. ##N ##. peace ##keepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide .
[unused1] [unused2] Writer and author Philip Go ##ure ##vi ##tch has described in detail how , three months before the genocide , Major General Romeo Dal ##lair ##e , the commander of several thousand U ##. ##N ##. troops in Rwanda , sent a f ##ax to Ko ##fi Anna ##n ' ##s office , saying he had received evidence from a Rwanda ##n government inform ##ant that genocide was being planned .
[unused1] [unused2] The inform ##ant offered to help U ##. ##N ##. forces in raiding the government stock ##pile ##s to be used in the genocide campaign .
[unused1] [unused2] He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now ##- ##in ##fa ##mous ` ##` genocide f ##ax ' ##' from Anna ##n ' ##s office .
[unused1] [unused2] It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwanda ##n government which was planning the genocide !
[unused1] [unused2] The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place .
[unused1] [unused2] Yu ##p , good o ##le Ko ##fi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide .
[unused1] [unused2] In an April 30 , 2001 , Washington Times column , Nat He ##nto ##ff noted that the media have devoted ` ##` scan ##t mention ' ##' to the ` ##` plain fact that it was Mr ##. Anna ##n , when he was head of the United Nation ' ##s peace ##keeping office , who could have prevented the slaughter of 800 ##, ##00 ##0 Tu ##ts ##is and their s ##ym ##path ##izer ##s in Rwanda in 1994 . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] It ' ##s true , He ##nto ##ff said , that the U ##. ##N ##. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged , to some extent , its role in the killings .
[unused1] [unused2] But for five and a half years , he noted , Anna ##n ` ##` refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwanda ##n ho ##loc ##aus ##t until Mr ##. Go ##ure ##vi ##tch and others revealed that less than 5 ##, ##00 ##0 U ##. ##N ##. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr ##. Anna ##n had not closed his eyes . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] After Christmas , I got a call from the wife of one of my former bosses - ##LR ##B ##- at my last full ##- ##time job - ##R ##RB ##- .
[unused1] [unused2] I started here 4 weeks ago .
[unused1] [unused2] My grandmother - ##LR ##B ##- who was Baptist - ##R ##RB ##- lived here for a few months before she died in 1995 , so I have many connections to the job .
[unused1] [unused2] My plan is to pay off my car early , and then work on the other debts .
[unused1] [unused2] three young boys , ages 2 , 5 and 10 survived and are in critical condition after spending in 18 hours in the cold .
[unused1] [unused2] the father , who was pilot ##ing the plane , also was rescued , but died late yesterday at the hospital .
[unused1] [unused2] the boys ' mother and two other brothers were killed .
[unused1] [unused2] officials say the pilot reported ice on the plane and planned to land in mass ##ach ##use ##tts when the plane left radar .
[unused1] [unused2] the family had been heading to new ha ##mps ##hire from lake ##land , fl ##ori ##da when their plane went down .

[unused1] [unused2] despite operating under bankruptcy laws , united posted the best on time performance .
[unused1] [unused2] of course there are ongoing fears about terrorism and a war with i ##ra ##q .
[unused1] [unused2] police in pen ##ns ##yl ##vani ##a a student fatal ##ly shot a principal before killing himself this morning .
[unused1] [unused2] it happened in the cafeteria of red lion area junior high school about 30 miles southeast of ha ##rri ##sburg .
[unused1] [unused2] it happened at 7 ##: ##30 this morning .
[unused1] [unused2] students then were moved across the street to a senior high school .
[unused1] [unused2] now you could call him the king of lawsuits .
[unused1] [unused2] mi ##cha ##el jack ##son filed suit against universal music , the parent company of m ##oto ##wn records saying he owe him for music he recorded with the jack ##son five back in the 1970s .
[unused1] [unused2] the glove ##d one claims the label has been releasing new albums and jack ##son five merchandise without giving him ` ##` a single dollar . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] in recent months , he ' ##s been sued by an auction house for non ##- ##pa ##yme ##nt , and by a concert promoter for allegedly backing out of two millennium performances .
[unused1] [unused2] the stay was granted to give the school districts involved in the initial cases 90 days to appeal to the u ##. ##s ##. supreme court here in washing ##ton .

[unused1] [unused2] reporter : and this is a military town , j ##ud ##y and little by little we are seeing these soldiers head out .
[unused1] [unused2] in a strange way and this may sound unusual , there ' ##s a little sense of relief because these soldiers were set to leave in j ##anu ##ary and now they got second deployment orders , the delay , of course , the inability to get access to turkey , but along the way , the 4th infantry division is one see ##ped in tradition and there ' ##s a real sense of pride among the soldiers , 250 of which left yesterday , over the course of the week 12 ##, ##00 ##0 will be leaving from here .
[unused1] [unused2] they are happy to be finally able to come and back up the first wave of troops that left from here .
[unused1] [unused2] they all tell me , the soldiers you talk to and also some of the information people here at fort hood , they train like they fight .
[unused1] [unused2] they are going over there to do a mission they believe in and as we said , 250 left yesterday .
[unused1] [unused2] their families were here to see them off , but they are determined to return though it is interesting to note that many of them , so many with young children have told their kids that mom or dad could be away for as long as a year .
[unused1] [unused2] the big focus is am ##eric ##an airlines , the board of the company meeting today , possibly discussing the future of c ##eo don cart ##y , he got in trouble when he jack ##ed up pension ##s of the guys in top while asking employees to take big pay cuts .
[unused1] [unused2] last night , former general electric c ##eo jack we ##l ##ch talked to p ##aul ##a z ##ahn about this issue of corporate g ##reed .
[unused1] [unused2] the board is who decides that and board is so often ch ##ock full of the c ##eo ##s golf ##ing b ##udd ##ies , they serve on each other ' ##s boards and problem here is gap between what the average worker makes and c ##eo is making is increasing and everyone agrees that is not a good thing for this country , plus the fact , when the guys get the big packages ##es , so often you see the companies going down the z ##b ##lub ##s thank you for up ##dating us .

[unused1] [unused2] it ' ##s been a year and a half since a series of ant ##hra ##x attacks killed five people .
[unused1] [unused2] no one has ever been arrested in connection with that case and the f ##bi is considering draining a ma ##ryl ##and pond relating to evidence for those un ##sol ##ved attacks .
[unused1] [unused2] after all , it is a murder investigation .
[unused1] [unused2] multiple murder investigation , so i ' ##m sure there are a number of avenue ##s that they ' ##re looking into .
[unused1] [unused2] officials say there is no evidence connecting anything found in the park to ant ##hra ##x or the ant ##hra ##x attacks .
[unused1] [unused2] nor is there any evidence linking any individual to the deadly ant ##hra ##x led ##ders .
[unused1] [unused2] well , the f ##bi can drain the p ##ac ##ific ocean but they w ##o n ##' ##t find any evidence that he was involved with the attacks because he had nothing to do with the ant ##hra ##x attacks at all .
[unused1] [unused2] 18 months later , still not one single arrest for those attacks that killed five people and sick ##ened 13 others .

[unused1] [unused2] At least 19 people were killed and 114 people were wounded in Tuesday ' ##s southern Philippines airport blast , officials said , but reports said the death toll could climb to 30 .
[unused1] [unused2] Radio station D ##X ##DC placed the death toll at 30 , without giving a source for the figure , which officials could not immediately confirm .
[unused1] [unused2] The Da ##va ##o Medical Center , a regional government hospital , recorded 19 deaths with 50 wounded .
[unused1] [unused2] Medical evacuation workers however said the injured list was around 114 , spread out at various hospitals .
[unused1] [unused2] A powerful bomb tore through a waiting shed at the Da ##va ##o City international airport at about 5 ##. ##15 pm - ##LR ##B ##- 09 ##15 GM ##T - ##R ##RB ##- while another explosion hit a bus terminal at the city .
[unused1] [unused2] There were no reports of injuries in the second blast .
[unused1] [unused2] The waiting shed literally exploded , ' ##' said Vice Mayor Luis Bon ##go ##yan , speaking to local radio station
[unused1] [unused2] Television footage showed medical teams cart ##ing away dozens of wounded victims with fully armed troops on guard .
[unused1] [unused2] H ##A ##IF ##A , Israel , March 5 - ##LR ##B ##- A ##FP - ##R ##RB ##- - Fifteen people were killed and more than 30 wounded Wednesday as a suicide bomber blew himself up on a student bus in the northern town of Haifa , the first bombing in Israel in exactly two months .
[unused1] [unused2] Several hours later , dozens of Israeli tanks advanced into the northern Gaza Strip backed by helicopters which fired at least three rockets in the J ##aba ##li ##ya area , Palestinian security sources said .
[unused1] [unused2] Palestinian medical sources said 60 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Mohammed al ##- ##B ##iya ##ri was killed in his home near J ##aba ##li ##ya refugee camp by the rocket fire and another wounded .
[unused1] [unused2] A second rocket landed in farmland ##s and the other hit a house inside the refugee camp , but without causing further casualties , Palestinian security sources said .
[unused1] [unused2] Two 13 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old children were among those killed in the Haifa bus bombing , Israeli public radio said , adding that most of the victims were young ##sters .
[unused1] [unused2] The bus was ripped to s ##hr ##eds while travelling between a residential area and Haifa university .
[unused1] [unused2] Israel ' ##s night ##- ##time raid in Gaza involving around 40 tanks and armoured vehicles came after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened his security cabinet to discuss a response to the bomb attack .
[unused1] [unused2] Israeli media said the retaliation was unlikely to be on a scale that would risk disrupt ##ing US preparations for war on Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] The Palestinian suicide bomber on the Haifa bus came from the southern West Bank town of He ##bro ##n , public radio said , naming him as 20 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Ma ##hm ##oud Ham ##ada ##n Sal ##im Q ##awa ##sm ##i .
[unused1] [unused2] Apart from his ID card , also found in the wreckage were the remains of a letter allegedly out ##lining his plan to carry out a suicide attack and praising the September 2001 destruction of the World Trade Centre in New York , it said .
[unused1] [unused2] Israeli forces moved into He ##bro ##n ' ##s Al ##- ##S ##he ##ik ##h district where his family lived and arrested Q ##awa ##sm ##i ' ##s brother and father after the bombing , they said .
[unused1] [unused2] Without claiming responsibility , Hamas and another hard ##line group , Islamic Ji ##had , said the blast was revenge for a string of bloody Israeli army raids into the Gaza Strip in recent weeks .
[unused1] [unused2] But the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack , saying it would diver ##t international sympathy away from the far higher Palestinian civilian death toll .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We con ##de ##m ##n all attacks against civilians including today ' ##s attack in Haifa , ' ##' said information minister Ya ##sser Abe ##d Ra ##bb ##o .
[unused1] [unused2] The Palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as ` ##` a pre ##text for Israel ' ##s government and occupation army to step up its deadly campaign which caused the deaths of 77 Palestinians in February ' ##' .
[unused1] [unused2] It was the first bomb attack inside Israel since January 5 , and came just days after the hawk ##ish Sharon appointed the most right ##- ##wing government in Israel ' ##s history on a pledge to get tough on security .
[unused1] [unused2] In the January attack , two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up in central Tel Aviv , killing 23 other people .
[unused1] [unused2] Israeli government spokesman A ##vi Paz ##ner called the latest deadly blast a ` ##` very grave attack ' ##' and said the Jewish state would take ` ##` vigorous action against the terrorist organisations ' ##' .
[unused1] [unused2] He told A ##FP that Israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least 40 tip ##- ##offs of impending attacks when the Haifa bus was blown up .
[unused1] [unused2] US President George W ##. Bush condemned the ` ##` attack on innocent ##s in Israel , ' ##' White House spokesman Ari F ##le ##ische ##r said , adding that ` ##` his message to the terrorists is : Their efforts will not be su ##cc ##cess ##ful .
[unused1] [unused2] EU foreign policy su ##p ##rem ##o Javier Sol ##ana likewise slammed the attack , although he also took a j ##ab at Israel , saying , ` ##` There have been too many civilians killed in the last weeks and the last days . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] The spokesman added that he ` ##` would obviously call on all sides to do what they can to break the cycle of violence , because it is only through engagement that we can realise the vision everyone wants to see .
[unused1] [unused2] The bus attack came just two days after Israeli forces staged a bloody raid into a refugee camp in central Gaza targeting a founding member of Hamas , which has spear ##headed suicide bombings against the Jewish state .
[unused1] [unused2] Hamas vowed to continue its attacks , while the Palestinian Authority accused Israel of trying to disrupt top ##- ##lev ##el Palestinian meetings to discuss reforms of Ara ##fa ##t ' ##s administration .
[unused1] [unused2] Palestinian chief ne ##got ##iator Sa ##eb Era ##kat said international intervention was needed to break the cycle of violence .
[unused1] [unused2] Eight people , including a pregnant woman and a 13 ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old child were killed in Monday ' ##s Gaza raid , pro ##voking US ##- ##led international calls for Israeli restraint .
[unused1] [unused2] And on Tuesday , Israeli troops shot dead an elderly Palestinian she ##pher ##d outside a Jewish settlement on the edge of Gaza City .
[unused1] [unused2] In the West Bank , an eight ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old Palestinian boy as well as his brother and a sister were wounded late Wednesday by Israeli gunfire in a village north of the town of Rama ##llah , their elder sister said .
[unused1] [unused2] The world ' ##s most powerful fine art auction houses , So ##the ##by ' ##s and Christie ' ##s , have agreed to pay 40 million dollars to settle an international price ##- ##fi ##xing s ##cam , So ##the ##by ' ##s said .
[unused1] [unused2] The payment , if approved by the courts , would settle a s ##lew of suits by clients over auction ##s held between 1993 and 2000 outside the United States , it said in a statement .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` Under the terms of the settlement agreement , So ##the ##by ' ##s and Christie ' ##s will each pay 20 million dollars , ' ##' said So ##the ##by ' ##s , which operates in 34 countries .
[unused1] [unused2] Buy ##ers and seller ##s also would have to agree not to pursue further cases in foreign courts .
[unused1] [unused2] The litigation covers buyers in auction ##s outside the United States between January 1 , 1993 and February 7 , 2000 , and seller ##s between September 1 , 1995 and February 7 , 2000 .
[unused1] [unused2] Similar claims over US ##- ##base ##d auction ##s were settled in an agreement struck in September 2000 for a total of 512 million dollars .
[unused1] [unused2] In December 2001 , a Manhattan jury convicted So ##the ##by ' ##s main shareholder and former chairman Alfred Tau ##b ##man of entering into a price ##- ##fi ##xing agreement with Christie ' ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Four months later , the billionaire was sentenced to one year in prison and a 7 ##. ##5 ##- ##mill ##ion ##- ##do ##llar fine over the price ##- ##fi ##xing , which prosecutors said had cost clients of both firms 400 million dollars .
[unused1] [unused2] Christie ' ##s was not prosecuted in the United States after its management agreed to testify against So ##the ##by ' ##s and provide documents needed to prove fraud ##ulent intent .
[unused1] [unused2] So ##the ##by ' ##s said it would record the 20 ##- ##mill ##ion ##- ##do ##llar settlement as a special charge for 2002 .
[unused1] [unused2] It would be funded in two payments of 10 million dollars each upon preliminary and final court approval .
[unused1] [unused2] E ##ff ##ort ##s were to continue at the United Nations Friday to find a breakthrough in the diplomatic s ##tale ##mate on Iraq , with Washington warning it could bypass the Security Council and go to war alone .
[unused1] [unused2] With marathon talks at the top world body failing late Thursday to reconcile French and Russian opposition to US ##- ##B ##rit ##ish war plans , the United States up ##ped its military presence , deploy ##ing more missile ##- ##fi ##ring warships to the Red Sea .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The six are now working on a paper and we will see the outcome of that consultation , maybe tomorrow - ##LR ##B ##- Friday - ##R ##RB ##- ' ##' Jean ##- ##M ##ar ##c de La Sa ##b ##lier ##e told reporters .
[unused1] [unused2] Am ##id talk of delay ##ing or even she ##lving a US ##- ##B ##rit ##ish resolution giving Iraqi President Saddam Hussein until Monday to di ##sar ##m or face war , oil prices in Asia pulled back , shares rose and the US dollar eased .
[unused1] [unused2] British efforts to provide a way out of the diplomatic mi ##re at the United Nations ended without agreement late Thursday , but with London ' ##s ambassador to the UN , Jeremy Greens ##tock , saying he expected talks to go on into the weekend .
[unused1] [unused2] His US counterpart , John Negro ##pont ##e , said : ` ##` I ca n ##' ##t say we are much farther along today than we were yesterday , ' ##' after hours of talks on six British bench ##marks to test Iraq ' ##s compliance with council demands .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We are still talking to the members of the council with respect to coal ##es ##cing around a position that would n ##' ##t draw a veto , but the options remain : go for a vote and see what members say , or not go for a vote , ' ##' Powell said .
[unused1] [unused2] Diploma ##tic w ##rang ##ling has centred around the French and Russian refusal to put their names to any resolution allowing the United States to un ##lea ##sh its military might against Iraq before weapons inspection ##s have run their course .
[unused1] [unused2] He repeated that Moscow would not back a resolution that authorised an attack against Iraq : ` ##` It is not necessary now to adopt any new resolution on Iraq , especially resolutions which lead to war . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] The United States meanwhile deployed its B ##- ##2 steal ##th bombers to positions closer to Iraq and ordered as many as 15 warships capable of firing Tom ##ah ##aw ##k cruise missiles to the Red Sea from the Mediterranean , US officials said .
[unused1] [unused2] Media t ##y ##coon Barry Di ##ller on Wednesday quit as chief of V ##ive ##ndi Universal Entertainment , the entertainment unit of French giant V ##ive ##ndi Universal whose future appears up for grabs .
[unused1] [unused2] In a statement , Di ##ller - ##- who took on the ` ##` provisional ' ##' role at the top of V ##ive ##ndi ' ##s US entertainment operations in December - ##- said his USA Interactive group will nonetheless remain a shareholder of V ##ive ##ndi Universal Entertainment .
[unused1] [unused2] As part of the 11 ##- ##bill ##ion ##- ##do ##llar sale of USA Interactive ' ##s film and television operations to the French media company in December 2001 , USA Interactive received 2 ##. ##5 billion dollars in preferred shares in V ##ive ##ndi Universal Entertainment .
[unused1] [unused2] In Paris , the French media group said parent company chairman Jean ##- ##R ##ene Four ##to ##u will replace Di ##ller as chairman and chief executive of US unit .
[unused1] [unused2] V ##ive ##ndi , in a statement , said that Di ##ller had , ` ##` in full agreement with V ##ive ##ndi Universal , ' ##' announced that he was ` ##` ending his temporary assignment as CEO of V ##ive ##ndi Universal Entertainment . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] V ##ive ##ndi Universal , the world ' ##s second ##- ##lar ##ges ##t media group after A ##OL Time Warner of the United States , has been digging out from under a mountain of debt since the removal of expansion ##ist boss Jean ##- ##M ##ari ##e Me ##ssie ##r last July , largely through asset sales .
[unused1] [unused2] S ##pec ##ulation has been r ##ife that troubled V ##ive ##ndi has been weighing a spin ##off or sale of its US film , television and theme park operations as part of its restructuring .
[unused1] [unused2] Ten ##s of thousands of people took to the streets across the Middle East Thursday , demonstrating against military strikes on Iraq and calling on Muslims to wage ji ##had against the United States and its allies .
[unused1] [unused2] Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority issued fierce den ##un ##ciation ##s of the US ##- ##led attacks , while the Egyptian government daily Al ##- ##A ##hra ##m warned it marked ` ##` the beginning an era of US co ##lon ##isation that will benefit only Israel ' ##' .
[unused1] [unused2] Pro ##test ##s against the action aimed at top ##pling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were held in cities across Libya , Egypt and Lebanon , as well as in Am ##man , Damascus and the Gaza Strip .
[unused1] [unused2] However , there were no reports of protests against the war from the Gulf states , many of whom are host to US military personnel .
[unused1] [unused2] Foreign Minister Prince Sa ##ud al ##- ##F ##ais ##al spoke of the ` ##` kingdom ' ##s hope for a quick halt in military action and for the return to peaceful efforts ' ##' , the state SP ##A news agency reported .
[unused1] [unused2] Lebanese President Emil ##e La ##hou ##d , meanwhile , was more forth ##right , strongly den ##ou ##ncing Washington ' ##s ` ##` aggression ' ##' and warning that it could have re ##per ##cus ##sions beyond the borders of the par ##iah state .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We have warned against the marginal ##isation of the United Nations ... and we see this aggression today p ##lung ##ing the world into a tunnel where one can not see the end , ' ##' he said in a statement .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` For these reasons , we judge that it is necessary that the forces of peace and those who believe in right and justice take the necessary and rapid steps to halt this dangerous slide into war against Iraq which will result in heavy human and material losses . ' ##'
[unused1] [unused2] The Palestinian Authority also condemned Thursday ' ##s early morning missile strikes on Iraq , and warned Israel not to exploit the conflict .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We Palestinians are against the war and we totally con ##de ##m ##n this war in the Middle East .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We are warning Israel not to exploit this war against Iraq to carry out more attacks against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and destroy the Palestinian Authority and the peace process , ' ##' he said .
[unused1] [unused2] The radical Palestinian movement Islamic Ji ##had warned that ` ##` the war against Iraq is a war against the whole region ' ##' , while Hamas issued a chill ##ing warning against those taking part in the war against Iraq .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` The aggression by the v ##ile Americans and the war against Iraq sign ##ifies a war against all Arabs and Muslims around the world , ' ##' said Hamas senior official Abdul Aziz al ##- ##R ##anti ##ssi .
[unused1] [unused2] The war ` ##` shows the imp ##ote ##nce of all Arab states .
[unused1] [unused2] We call on all Arab states to act immediately to defend Iraq and counter the US war , ' ##' he said .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` I do n ##' ##t think America will win this war , as our ji ##had - ##LR ##B ##- holy war - ##R ##RB ##- and our resistance will teach the Americans and British a lesson they will never forget , ' ##' he said .
[unused1] [unused2] In the Egyptian capital , 10 demons ##tra ##tors and at least four policeman were injured in clashes after several thousand demons ##tra ##tors took to the streets near the US and British em ##bas ##sies .
[unused1] [unused2] Riot police intervened after the protest ##ors , who included hundreds of students from the American University in Cairo , rallied on the city ' ##s central Ta ##hr ##ir Square , close to both the university campus and the US embassy .
[unused1] [unused2] More than 1 ##, ##00 ##0 people also gathered at Cairo ' ##s Al ##- ##A ##z ##har Islamic University , where they burned an American flag and demanded the expulsion of the ambassador ##s of the United States , Britain , Spain and Israel .
[unused1] [unused2] Demons ##tration ##s also took place in the northern Egyptian cities of Alexandria , Tan ##ta and Ka ##f ##r el ##- ##S ##he ##ik ##h .
[unused1] [unused2] In Am ##man , three protest ##ors were hospital ##ised after some 500 Jordan ##ian lawyers staged a sit ##- ##in at the main court house after being forcibly blocked by riot police from marching towards the Iraqi embassy to show their solidarity .
[unused1] [unused2] In Lebanon , hundreds of students gathered on the campuses of the Arab University of Beirut and the American University of Beirut calling for the assassination of US President George W ##. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
[unused1] [unused2] Indonesia will delay the execution of six convict ##s including an Indian on death row after five of them appealed to the Supreme Court for a second review , prosecutors said Thursday .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` If we execute them now we ca n ##' ##t bring them to life again should their appeals for a review be granted , ' ##' said An ##tas ##ari A ##z ##har , spokesman for the attorney general ' ##s office .
[unused1] [unused2] The Supreme Court rejected earlier appeals for a case review from five of the convict ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] The sixth off ##ender has only made one appeal for a review .
[unused1] [unused2] President Mega ##wati Su ##kar ##no ##put ##ri has refused c ##lem ##ency for the six and asked for a speed ##y execution .
[unused1] [unused2] Five of them are Indonesian ##s convicted of murders while the other is an Indian drug off ##ender , A ##yo ##dh ##ya Prasad Cha ##ube ##y .
[unused1] [unused2] ` ##` We are talking about someone ' ##s life or death so we have to be very careful , ' ##' A ##z ##har said .
[unused1] [unused2] A convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential c ##lem ##ency only after the Supreme Court up ##hold ##s a sentence imposed by a lower court .
[unused1] [unused2] Apart from those convicted of murder , 16 people are on death row for drug trafficking - ##- 11 foreigners , four Indonesian ##s and a Dutch citizen of Chinese ##- ##I ##ndon ##esi ##an origin .
[unused1] [unused2] Indonesian courts have increasingly handed out severe sentences , including death , for drug smug ##gler ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Amnesty International has appealed to Indonesia to spare the lives of convicted drug offenders and others , saying there was no proof the death penalty de ##ters would ##- ##be traffic ##kers more effectively than other punishment ##s .
[unused1] [unused2] Amnesty oppose ##s the death penalty for any crime .
[unused1] [unused2] Use of the death penalty is rare in Indonesia , where the last execution was carried out in May 2001 of two men convicted of a murder in 1989 .
[unused1] [unused2] A police firing squad enforce ##s the penalty .
[unused1] [unused2] Thousands of fresh US troops headed for Iraq Thursday as British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W ##. Bush discussed the effort to ou ##st Saddam Hussein , which some senior US military officials warn could last months .
[unused1] [unused2] About 1 ##, ##00 ##0 soldiers from the US Army ' ##s 173 ##rd Airborne Brigade parachute ##d into an airfield in a Kurdish ##- ##con ##tro ##lled area of northern Iraq , establishing a base through which to bring in more troops and tanks , Pentagon officials said .
[unused1] [unused2] And some 12 ##, ##00 ##0 soldiers from the US Army ' ##s 4th Infantry Division , which was supposed to have gone into northern Iraq through Turkey , began flying out of Fort Hood , Texas , Thursday to the region , a military fort spoke ##s ##woman told A ##FP .
[unused1] [unused2] The war in Iraq could last months and require considerable US military reinforcements to assure a victory , the Washington Post reported Thursday , q ##uo ##ting senior US military officials .
